      "HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.\n",
      "“Zarathustra” is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history\n",
      "of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals,\n",
      "raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however,\n",
      "there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and\n",
      "remotest aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from\n",
      "his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had\n",
      "dreamt of him. At different periods in his life, he would call this\n",
      "haunter of his dreams by different names; “but in the end,” he declares\n",
      "in a note on the subject, “I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of\n",
      "identifying him with this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first\n",
      "to take a broad and comprehensive view of history. Every series of\n",
      "evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every\n",
      "prophet had his ‘Hazar,’—his dynasty of a thousand years.”\n",
      "All Zarathustra’s views, as also his personality, were early\n",
      "conceptions of my brother’s mind. Whoever reads his posthumously\n",
      "published writings for the years 1869-82 with care, will constantly meet\n",
      "with passages suggestive of Zarathustra’s thoughts and doctrines. For\n",
      "instance, the ideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all\n",
      "his writings during the years 1873-75; and in “We Philologists”, the\n",
      "following remarkable observations occur:—\n",
      "“How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the\n",
      "Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.”\n",
      "“The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they\n",
      "reared such a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible?\n",
      "The question is one which ought to be studied.\n",
      "“I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of\n",
      "the individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually\n",
      "favourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing\n",
      "to the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their\n",
      "evil instincts.\n",
      "“WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE\n",
      "REARED WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO\n",
      "HERETOFORE HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. Here we may still\n",
      "be hopeful: in the rearing of exceptional men.”\n",
      "The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal\n",
      "Nietzsche already had in his youth, that “THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD\n",
      "LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS” (or, as he writes in “Schopenhauer as\n",
      "Educator”: “Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great\n",
      "men—this and nothing else is its duty.”) But the ideals he most revered\n",
      "in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No,\n",
      "around this future ideal of a coming humanity—the Superman—the poet\n",
      "spread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious heights man\n",
      "can still ascend? That is why, after having tested the worth of our\n",
      "noblest ideal—that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations,\n",
      "the poet cries with passionate emphasis in “Zarathustra”:\n",
      "“Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of\n",
      "them, the greatest and the smallest man:—\n",
      "All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the\n",
      "greatest found I—all-too-human!”—\n",
      "The phrase “the rearing of the Superman,” has very often been\n",
      "misunderstood. By the word “rearing,” in this case, is meant the act of\n",
      "modifying by means of new and higher values—values which, as laws and\n",
      "guides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In general\n",
      "the doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in\n",
      "conjunction with other ideas of the author’s, such as:—the Order of\n",
      "Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He\n",
      "assumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched\n",
      "and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and\n",
      "powerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that,\n",
      "in consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have\n",
      "been seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations must\n",
      "be placed over mankind—namely, that of the strong, mighty, and\n",
      "magnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith—the\n",
      "Superman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the aim\n",
      "of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing,\n",
      "which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering,\n",
      "and the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and\n",
      "“modern” race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear\n",
      "a healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory\n",
      "to life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system\n",
      "of valuing would be: “All that proceeds from power is good, all that\n",
      "springs from weakness is bad.”\n",
      "This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a\n",
      "nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote\n",
      "period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the\n",
      "Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would\n",
      "therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be a\n",
      "possibility which men of the present could realise with all their\n",
      "spiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new\n",
      "values.\n",
      "The author of “Zarathustra” never lost sight of that egregious\n",
      "example of a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby\n",
      "the whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well\n",
      "as strong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a\n",
      "comparatively short time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of\n",
      "valuing (once it had been refined and made more profound by the\n",
      "schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect\n",
      "another such revolution within a calculable period of time, until that\n",
      "glorious type of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new\n",
      "faith and hope, and in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to\n",
      "participate?\n",
      "In his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression\n",
      "“Superman” (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying “the most\n",
      "thoroughly well-constituted type,” as opposed to “modern man”; above\n",
      "all, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the\n",
      "Superman. In “Ecco Homo” he is careful to enlighten us concerning the\n",
      "precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in\n",
      "referring to a certain passage in the “Gay Science”:—\n",
      "“In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in\n",
      "regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this\n",
      "condition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS. I know not how to express my\n",
      "meaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in one\n",
      "of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the ‘Gaya\n",
      "Scienza’.”\n",
      "“We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,”—it says\n",
      "there,—“we firstlings of a yet untried future—we require for a new end\n",
      "also a new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher,\n",
      "bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul longeth\n",
      "to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values and\n",
      "desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal\n",
      "‘Mediterranean Sea’, who, from the adventures of his most personal\n",
      "experience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer\n",
      "of the ideal—as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the\n",
      "legislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the\n",
      "godly non-conformist of the old style:—requires one thing above all for\n",
      "that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS—such healthiness as one not only\n",
      "possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one\n",
      "unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!—And now, after\n",
      "having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the ideal,\n",
      "more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked and\n",
      "brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy\n",
      "again,—it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a\n",
      "still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one has\n",
      "yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known\n",
      "hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the strange, the\n",
      "questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well\n",
      "as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand—alas! that\n",
      "nothing will now any longer satisfy us!—\n",
      "“How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY after\n",
      "such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and\n",
      "consciousness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on\n",
      "the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present-day with\n",
      "ill-concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.\n",
      "Another ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of\n",
      "danger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we do\n",
      "not so readily acknowledge any one’s RIGHT THERETO: the ideal of a\n",
      "spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from\n",
      "overflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto been\n",
      "called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest\n",
      "conception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value,\n",
      "would already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement, or at least\n",
      "relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetfulness; the ideal of a\n",
      "humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often enough\n",
      "appear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past seriousness\n",
      "on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing, word, tone,\n",
      "look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary parody—and WITH\n",
      "which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS only commences, when\n",
      "the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the soul changes,\n",
      "the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins...”\n",
      "Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading\n",
      "thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and\n",
      "writings of the author, “Thus Spake Zarathustra” did not actually come\n",
      "into being until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the\n",
      "idea of the Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my\n",
      "brother to set forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his\n",
      "first conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, “Ecce Homo”,\n",
      "written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following passage:—\n",
      "“The fundamental idea of my work—namely, the Eternal Recurrence of\n",
      "all things—this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying\n",
      "philosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881. I made a note of the\n",
      "thought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond men\n",
      "and time! That day I happened to be wandering through the woods\n",
      "alongside of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge,\n",
      "pyramidal and towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the\n",
      "thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two months\n",
      "previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the\n",
      "form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes—more particularly\n",
      "in music. It would even be possible to consider all ‘Zarathustra’ as a\n",
      "musical composition. At all events, a very necessary condition in its\n",
      "production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small\n",
      "mountain resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of\n",
      "1881, I and my friend and Maestro, Peter Gast—also one who had been born\n",
      "again—discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore\n",
      "lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore.”\n",
      "During the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the\n",
      "teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form,\n",
      "through the mouth of Zarathustra. Among the notes of this period, we\n",
      "found a page on which is written the first definite plan of “Thus Spake\n",
      "Zarathustra”:—\n",
      "“MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.” “GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.”\n",
      "Beneath this is written:—\n",
      "“Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year,\n",
      "went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the\n",
      "mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta.”\n",
      "“The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent of\n",
      "eternity lies coiled in its light—: It is YOUR time, ye midday\n",
      "brethren.”\n",
      "In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily\n",
      "declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush\n",
      "of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not\n",
      "only “The Gay Science”, which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude\n",
      "to “Zarathustra”, but also “Zarathustra” itself. Just as he was\n",
      "beginning to recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought\n",
      "him a number of most painful personal experiences. His friends caused\n",
      "him many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as\n",
      "he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first\n",
      "time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to\n",
      "which, perhaps, all greatness is condemned. But to be forsaken is\n",
      "something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness.\n",
      "How he longed, in those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly\n",
      "understand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he\n",
      "imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest\n",
      "youth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more\n",
      "perilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him: he therefore\n",
      "created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic\n",
      "philosopher, and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "Whether my brother would ever have written “Thus Spake Zarathustra”\n",
      "according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he had\n",
      "not had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle\n",
      "question; but perhaps where “Zarathustra” is concerned, we may also say\n",
      "with Master Eckhardt: “The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is\n",
      "suffering.”\n",
      "My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of\n",
      "“Zarathustra”:—“In the winter of 1882-83, I was living on the charming\n",
      "little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari and\n",
      "Cape Porto Fino. My health was not very good; the winter was cold and\n",
      "exceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close to\n",
      "the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were\n",
      "high. These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable;\n",
      "and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that\n",
      "everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was\n",
      "precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable\n",
      "circumstances that my ‘Zarathustra’ originated. In the morning I used to\n",
      "start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which\n",
      "rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into\n",
      "the sea. In the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked\n",
      "round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This\n",
      "spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly\n",
      "loved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to\n",
      "be there again when he was revisiting this small, forgotten world of\n",
      "happiness for the last time. It was on these two roads that all\n",
      "‘Zarathustra’ came to me, above all Zarathustra himself as a type;—I\n",
      "ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "The first part of “Zarathustra” was written in about ten days—that is\n",
      "to say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883. “The\n",
      "last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard\n",
      "Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice.”\n",
      "With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first\n",
      "part of this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the\n",
      "hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced. He did not, however, mean\n",
      "thereby that his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was\n",
      "suffering from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa\n",
      "Margherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival\n",
      "in Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was\n",
      "his spiritual condition—that indescribable forsakenness—to which he\n",
      "gives such heartrending expression in “Zarathustra”. Even the reception\n",
      "which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances\n",
      "was extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented\n",
      "copies of the work misunderstood it. “I found no one ripe for many of my\n",
      "thoughts; the case of ‘Zarathustra’ proves that one can speak with the\n",
      "utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one.” My brother was very\n",
      "much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as\n",
      "he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of\n",
      "chloral—a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,—the\n",
      "following spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him. He\n",
      "writes about it as follows:—“I spent a melancholy spring in Rome, where\n",
      "I only just managed to live,—and this was no easy matter. This city,\n",
      "which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of ‘Zarathustra’, and\n",
      "for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately\n",
      "miserable. I tried to leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila—the opposite of\n",
      "Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity\n",
      "towards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as a\n",
      "memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church—a person very\n",
      "closely related to me,—the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II.\n",
      "But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome. In the end I\n",
      "was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had\n",
      "exerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that on\n",
      "one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually\n",
      "inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a\n",
      "quiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza just\n",
      "mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could hear\n",
      "the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was\n",
      "composed—‘The Night-Song’. About this time I was obsessed by an\n",
      "unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words,\n",
      "‘dead through immortality.’”\n",
      "We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the\n",
      "effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already\n",
      "described, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case,\n",
      "not to proceed with “Zarathustra”, although I offered to relieve him of\n",
      "all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher. When,\n",
      "however, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he\n",
      "found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the\n",
      "mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and in a note to me\n",
      "announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, he wrote as follows: “I have\n",
      "engaged a place here for three months: forsooth, I am the greatest fool\n",
      "to allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now\n",
      "and again I am troubled by the thought: WHAT NEXT? My ‘future’ is the\n",
      "darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a great\n",
      "deal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of doing this than\n",
      "of my future, and leave the rest to THEE and the gods.”\n",
      "The second part of “Zarathustra” was written between the 26th of June\n",
      "and the 6th July. “This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred\n",
      "place where the first thought of ‘Zarathustra’ flashed across my mind, I\n",
      "conceived the second part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second,\n",
      "the first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer.”\n",
      "He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote\n",
      "“Zarathustra”; how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd\n",
      "into his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note-book\n",
      "from which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working\n",
      "till midnight. He says in a letter to me: “You can have no idea of the\n",
      "vehemence of such composition,” and in “Ecce Homo” (autumn 1888) he\n",
      "describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in\n",
      "which he created Zarathustra:—\n",
      "“—Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct\n",
      "notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word\n",
      "inspiration? If not, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige\n",
      "of superstition in one, it would hardly be possible to set aside\n",
      "completely the idea that one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or\n",
      "medium of an almighty power. The idea of revelation in the sense that\n",
      "something becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable\n",
      "certainty and accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets\n",
      "one—describes simply the matter of fact. One hears—one does not seek;\n",
      "one takes—one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like\n",
      "lightning, it comes with necessity, unhesitatingly—I have never had any\n",
      "choice in the matter. There is an ecstasy such that the immense strain\n",
      "of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one’s\n",
      "steps either rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the\n",
      "feeling that one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct\n",
      "consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the\n",
      "very toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and\n",
      "gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded\n",
      "in the sense of necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light.\n",
      "There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of\n",
      "forms (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the\n",
      "measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its\n",
      "pressure and tension). Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in\n",
      "a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and\n",
      "divinity. The involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most\n",
      "remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the\n",
      "figure and what constitutes the simile; everything seems to present\n",
      "itself as the readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of\n",
      "expression. It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra’s own phrases,\n",
      "as if all things came unto one, and would fain be similes: ‘Here do all\n",
      "things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to\n",
      "ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth.\n",
      "Here fly open unto thee all being’s words and word-cabinets; here all\n",
      "being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of\n",
      "thee how to talk.’ This is MY experience of inspiration. I do not doubt\n",
      "but that one would have to go back thousands of years in order to find\n",
      "some one who could say to me: It is mine also!—”\n",
      "In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and\n",
      "stayed there a few weeks. In the following winter, after wandering\n",
      "somewhat erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in\n",
      "Nice, where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that he\n",
      "wrote the third part of “Zarathustra”. “In the winter, beneath the\n",
      "halcyon sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time\n",
      "in my life, I found the third ‘Zarathustra’—and came to the end of my\n",
      "task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden corners\n",
      "and heights in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by\n",
      "unforgettable moments. That decisive chapter entitled ‘Old and New\n",
      "Tables’ was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station to\n",
      "Eza—that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative\n",
      "moments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The body\n",
      "is inspired: let us waive the question of the ‘soul.’ I might often have\n",
      "been seen dancing in those days. Without a suggestion of fatigue I could\n",
      "then walk for seven or eight hours on end among the hills. I slept well\n",
      "and laughed well—I was perfectly robust and patient.”\n",
      "As we have seen, each of the three parts of “Zarathustra” was\n",
      "written, after a more or less short period of preparation, in about ten\n",
      "days. The composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional\n",
      "interruptions. The first notes relating to this part were written while\n",
      "he and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884. In the\n",
      "following November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate\n",
      "these notes, and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice\n",
      "between the end of January and the middle of February 1885. My brother\n",
      "then called this part the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly\n",
      "after it had been privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still\n",
      "intended writing a fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these\n",
      "parts are now in my possession. This fourth part (the original MS. of\n",
      "which contains this note: “Only for my friends, not for the public”) is\n",
      "written in a particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he\n",
      "presented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning\n",
      "its contents. He often thought of making this fourth part public also,\n",
      "but doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably\n",
      "altering certain portions of it. At all events he resolved to distribute\n",
      "this manuscript production, of which only forty copies were printed,\n",
      "only among those who had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks\n",
      "eloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days,\n",
      "that he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book according\n",
      "to this resolution.\n",
      "Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons\n",
      "which led my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation of his ideal\n",
      "of the majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, for choosing\n",
      "Zarathustra of all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the\n",
      "following words:—“People have never asked me, as they should have done,\n",
      "what the name Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of\n",
      "the first Immoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all\n",
      "others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of\n",
      "an immoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between\n",
      "good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things. The\n",
      "translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in\n",
      "itself, was HIS work. But the very question suggests its own answer.\n",
      "Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he\n",
      "should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error, not only because he has\n",
      "had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other\n",
      "thinker—all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of the\n",
      "so-called moral order of things:—the more important point is that\n",
      "Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker. In his teaching\n",
      "alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue—i.e.:\n",
      "the reverse of the COWARDICE of the ‘idealist’ who flees from reality.\n",
      "Zarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before\n",
      "or after him. To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT: that is the first\n",
      "Persian virtue. Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through\n",

      "When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake\n",
      "of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit\n",
      "and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his\n",
      "heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before\n",
      "the sun, and spake thus unto it:\n",
      "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those\n",
      "for whom thou shinest!\n",
      "For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst\n",
      "have wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me,\n",
      "mine eagle, and my serpent.\n",
      "But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and\n",
      "blessed thee for it.\n",
      "Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much\n",
      "honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.\n",
      "I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more\n",
      "become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\n",
      "Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening,\n",
      "when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the\n",
      "nether-world, thou exuberant star!\n",
      "Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\n",
      "Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the\n",
      "greatest happiness without envy!\n",
      "Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow\n",
      "golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\n",
      "Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again\n",
      "going to be a man.\n",
      "Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him. When he\n",
      "entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man,\n",
      "who had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to\n",
      "Zarathustra:\n",
      "“No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.\n",
      "Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.\n",
      "Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now\n",
      "carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary’s\n",
      "doom?\n",
      "Yea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing\n",
      "lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?\n",
      "Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened\n",
      "one is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?\n",
      "As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up.\n",
      "Alas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body\n",
      "thyself?”\n",
      "Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”\n",
      "“Why,” said the saint, “did I go into the forest and the desert? Was\n",
      "it not because I loved men far too well?\n",
      "Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too imperfect for\n",
      "me. Love to man would be fatal to me.”\n",
      "Zarathustra answered: “What spake I of love! I am bringing gifts unto\n",
      "men.”\n",
      "“Give them nothing,” said the saint. “Take rather part of their load,\n",
      "and carry it along with them—that will be most agreeable unto them: if\n",
      "only it be agreeable unto thee!\n",
      "If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an\n",
      "alms, and let them also beg for it!”\n",
      "“No,” replied Zarathustra, “I give no alms. I am not poor enough for\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: “Then see to it\n",
      "that they accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and\n",
      "do not believe that we come with gifts.\n",
      "The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets.\n",
      "And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long\n",
      "before sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the\n",
      "thief?\n",
      "Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why\n",
      "not be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?”\n",
      "“And what doeth the saint in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.\n",
      "The saint answered: “I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns\n",
      "I laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.\n",
      "With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who\n",
      "is my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?”\n",
      "When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and\n",
      "said: “What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I\n",
      "take aught away from thee!”—And thus they parted from one another, the\n",
      "old man and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.\n",
      "When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “Could it\n",
      "be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that\n",
      "GOD IS DEAD!”\n",
      "3.\n",
      "When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the\n",
      "forest, he found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had\n",
      "been announced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. And\n",
      "Zarathustra spake thus unto the people:\n",
      "I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed.\n",
      "What have ye done to surpass man?\n",
      "All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye\n",

      "When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the\n",
      "people, and was silent. “There they stand,” said he to his heart; “there\n",

      "will appeal to their pride.\n",
      "I will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however,\n",
      "is THE LAST MAN!”\n",
      "And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:\n",
      "It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the\n",
      "germ of his highest hope.\n",
      "Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be\n",
      "poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow\n",
      "thereon.\n",
      "Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow\n",
      "of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned\n",
      "to whizz!\n",
      "I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a\n",
      "dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.\n",
      "Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any\n",
      "star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no\n",
      "longer despise himself.\n",
      "Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\n",
      "“What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?”—so\n",
      "asketh the last man and blinketh.\n",
      "The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last\n",
      "man who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that\n",
      "of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\n",
      "“We have discovered happiness”—say the last men, and blink\n",
      "thereby.\n",
      "They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need\n",
      "warmth. One still loveth one’s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for\n",
      "one needeth warmth.\n",
      "Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk\n",
      "warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!\n",
      "A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much\n",
      "poison at last for a pleasant death.\n",
      "One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the\n",
      "pastime should hurt one.\n",
      "One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who\n",
      "still wanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too\n",
      "burdensome.\n",
      "No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is\n",
      "equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the\n",

      "“Formerly all the world was insane,”—say the subtlest of them, and\n",
      "blink thereby.\n",
      "They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end\n",
      "to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon\n",
      "reconciled—otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.\n",
      "They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little\n",
      "pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health.\n",
      "“We have discovered happiness,”—say the last men, and blink\n",
      "thereby.—\n",
      "And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also\n",
      "called “The Prologue”: for at this point the shouting and mirth of the\n",
      "multitude interrupted him. “Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,”—they\n",
      "called out—“make us into these last men! Then will we make thee a\n",
      "present of the Superman!” And all the people exulted and smacked their\n",
      "lips. Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart:\n",
      "“They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.\n",
      "Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I\n",
      "hearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak unto them as unto\n",
      "the goatherds.\n",
      "Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But\n",
      "they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.\n",
      "And now do they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate\n",
      "me too. There is ice in their laughter.”\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and\n",
      "every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had\n",
      "commenced his performance: he had come out at a little door, and was\n",
      "going along the rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it\n",
      "hung above the market-place and the people. When he was just midway\n",
      "across, the little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow\n",
      "like a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. “Go on,\n",
      "halt-foot,” cried his frightful voice, “go on, lazy-bones, interloper,\n",
      "sallow-face!—lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here\n",
      "between the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be\n",
      "locked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!”—And with\n",
      "every word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he\n",
      "was but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made\n",
      "every mouth mute and every eye fixed—he uttered a yell like a devil, and\n",
      "jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when he\n",
      "thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his\n",
      "footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster\n",
      "than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place\n",
      "and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew\n",
      "apart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.\n",
      "Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the\n",
      "body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while\n",
      "consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra\n",
      "kneeling beside him. “What art thou doing there?” said he at last, “I\n",
      "knew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to\n",
      "hell: wilt thou prevent him?”\n",
      "“On mine honour, my friend,” answered Zarathustra, “there is nothing\n",
      "of all that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy\n",
      "soul will be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing\n",
      "any more!”\n",
      "The man looked up distrustfully. “If thou speakest the truth,” said\n",
      "he, “I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an\n",
      "animal which hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.”\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “thou hast made danger thy calling;\n",
      "therein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou perishest by thy\n",
      "calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.”\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further;\n",
      "but he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in\n",
      "gratitude.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in\n",
      "gloom. Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become\n",
      "fatigued. Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the\n",
      "ground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it\n",
      "became night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose\n",
      "Zarathustra and said to his heart:\n",
      "Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is not\n",
      "a man he hath caught, but a corpse.\n",
      "Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be\n",
      "fateful to it.\n",
      "I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the\n",
      "Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud—man.\n",
      "But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their\n",
      "sense. To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.\n",
      "Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. Come, thou\n",
      "cold and stiff companion! I carry thee to the place where I shall bury\n",
      "thee with mine own hands.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon\n",
      "his shoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he not gone a hundred\n",
      "steps, when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear—and lo!\n",
      "he that spake was the buffoon from the tower. “Leave this town, O\n",
      "Zarathustra,” said he, “there are too many here who hate thee. The good\n",
      "and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the\n",
      "believers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to\n",
      "the multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou\n",
      "spakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate with the\n",
      "dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day.\n",
      "Depart, however, from this town,—or to-morrow I shall jump over thee, a\n",
      "living man over a dead one.” And when he had said this, the buffoon\n",
      "vanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.\n",
      "At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their\n",
      "torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided\n",
      "him. “Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that\n",
      "Zarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly\n",
      "for that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well\n",
      "then, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief\n",
      "than Zarathustra!—he will steal them both, he will eat them both!” And\n",
      "they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.\n",
      "Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had\n",
      "gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of\n",
      "the hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he\n",
      "halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.\n",
      "“Hunger attacketh me,” said Zarathustra, “like a robber. Among\n",
      "forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.\n",
      "“Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a\n",
      "repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?”\n",
      "And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old\n",
      "man appeared, who carried a light, and asked: “Who cometh unto me and my\n",
      "bad sleep?”\n",
      "“A living man and a dead one,” said Zarathustra. “Give me something\n",
      "to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry\n",
      "refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.”\n",
      "The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered\n",
      "Zarathustra bread and wine. “A bad country for the hungry,” said he;\n",
      "“that is why I live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite.\n",
      "But bid thy companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.”\n",
      "Zarathustra answered: “My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to\n",
      "persuade him to eat.” “That doth not concern me,” said the old man\n",
      "sullenly; “he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat,\n",
      "and fare ye well!”—\n",
      "Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the\n",
      "path and the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker,\n",
      "and liked to look into the face of all that slept. When the morning\n",
      "dawned, however, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no\n",
      "path was any longer visible. He then put the dead man in a hollow tree\n",
      "at his head—for he wanted to protect him from the wolves—and laid\n",
      "himself down on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep,\n",
      "tired in body, but with a tranquil soul.\n",
      "9.\n",
      "Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his\n",
      "head, but also the morning. At last, however, his eyes opened, and\n",
      "amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed\n",
      "into himself. Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once\n",
      "seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he\n",
      "spake thus to his heart:\n",
      "A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions—living ones; not dead\n",
      "companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.\n",
      "But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to\n",
      "follow themselves—and to the place where I will.\n",
      "A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to\n",
      "speak, but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd’s herdsman\n",
      "and hound!\n",
      "To allure many from the herd—for that purpose have I come. The people\n",
      "and the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called\n",
      "by the herdsmen.\n",
      "Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just.\n",
      "Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox\n",
      "belief.\n",
      "Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up\n",
      "their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker:—he, however, is\n",
      "the creator.\n",
      "Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who\n",
      "breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker—he,\n",
      "however, is the creator.\n",
      "Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses—and not herds or\n",
      "believers either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh—those who grave\n",
      "new values on new tables.\n",
      "Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything\n",
      "is ripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so\n",

      "Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and\n",
      "fellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and\n",
      "herdsmen and corpses!\n",
      "And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee\n",
      "in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.\n",
      "But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. ‘Twixt rosy dawn and\n",
      "rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth.\n",
      "I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any\n",
      "more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken\n",
      "unto the dead.\n",
      "With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate:\n",
      "the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.\n",
      "To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers;\n",
      "and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart\n",
      "heavy with my happiness.\n",
      "I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy\n",
      "will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!\n",
      "10.\n",
      "This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at\n",
      "noontide. Then he looked inquiringly aloft,—for he heard above him the\n",
      "sharp call of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide\n",
      "circles, and on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend:\n",
      "for it kept itself coiled round the eagle’s neck.\n",
      "“They are mine animals,” said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "“The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the\n",
      "sun,—they have come out to reconnoitre.\n",
      "They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I\n",
      "still live?\n",
      "More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in\n",
      "dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!”\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint\n",
      "in the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:\n",
      "“Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart,\n",
      "like my serpent!\n",
      "But I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go\n",
      "always with my wisdom!\n",
      "And if my wisdom should some day forsake me:—alas! it loveth to fly\n",
      "away!—may my pride then fly with my folly!”\n",

      "I. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.\n",
      "Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the\n",
      "spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a\n",
      "child.\n",
      "Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing\n",
      "spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest\n",
      "longeth its strength.\n",
      "What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it\n",
      "down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.\n",
      "What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing\n",
      "spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\n",
      "Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride?\n",
      "To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?\n",
      "Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph?\n",
      "To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?\n",
      "Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for\n",
      "the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?\n",
      "Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of\n",
      "the deaf, who never hear thy requests?\n",
      "Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth,\n",
      "and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?\n",
      "Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to\n",
      "the phantom when it is going to frighten us?\n",
      "All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself:\n",
      "and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so\n",
      "hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.\n",
      "But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis:\n",
      "here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship\n",
      "in its own wilderness.\n",
      "Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its\n",
      "last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.\n",
      "What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to\n",
      "call Lord and God? “Thou shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the\n",
      "spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”\n",
      "“Thou shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered\n",
      "beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”\n",
      "The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus\n",
      "speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things—glitter\n",
      "on me.\n",
      "All values have already been created, and all created values—do I\n",
      "represent. Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more.” Thus speaketh\n",
      "the dragon.\n",
      "My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why\n",
      "sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?\n",
      "To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but\n",
      "to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion\n",
      "do.\n",
      "To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for\n",
      "that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.\n",
      "To assume the right to new values—that is the most formidable\n",
      "assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a\n",
      "spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.\n",
      "As its holiest, it once loved “Thou shalt”: now is it forced to find\n",
      "illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may\n",
      "capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.\n",
      "But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion\n",
      "could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?\n",
      "Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a\n",

      "child.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which\n",
      "is called The Pied Cow.\n",
      "II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.\n",
      "People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could\n",
      "discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and\n",
      "rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went\n",
      "Zarathustra, and sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake\n",
      "the wise man:\n",
      "Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing!\n",
      "And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at\n",
      "night!\n",
      "Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth\n",
      "softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman;\n",
      "immodestly he carrieth his horn.\n",
      "No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep\n",
      "awake all day.\n",
      "Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome\n",
      "weariness, and is poppy to the soul.\n",
      "Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is\n",
      "bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.\n",
      "Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek\n",
      "truth during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.\n",
      "Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise\n",
      "thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to\n",
      "sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?\n",
      "Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant? All that would ill accord\n",
      "with good sleep.\n",
      "And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing\n",
      "needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.\n",
      "That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And\n",
      "about thee, thou unhappy one!\n",
      "Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace\n",
      "also with thy neighbour’s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked\n",
      "government! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to\n",
      "walk on crooked legs?\n",
      "He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for\n",
      "me the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.\n",
      "Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen.\n",
      "But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.\n",
      "A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must\n",
      "come and go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.\n",
      "Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep.\n",
      "Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them.\n",
      "Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take\n",
      "I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned—sleep, the\n",
      "lord of the virtues!\n",
      "But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus\n",
      "ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten\n",
      "overcomings?\n",
      "And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the\n",
      "ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?\n",
      "Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all\n",
      "at once—sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.\n",
      "Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my\n",
      "mouth, and it remaineth open.\n",
      "Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and\n",
      "stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic\n",
      "chair.\n",
      "But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.—\n",
      "When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his\n",
      "heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him. And thus spake he to his\n",
      "heart:\n",
      "A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe\n",
      "he knoweth well how to sleep.\n",
      "Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is\n",
      "contagious—even through a thick wall it is contagious.\n",
      "A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the\n",
      "youths sit before the preacher of virtue.\n",
      "His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if\n",
      "life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the\n",
      "desirablest nonsense for me also.\n",
      "Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they\n",
      "sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and\n",
      "poppy-head virtues to promote it!\n",
      "To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep\n",
      "without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.\n",
      "Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of\n",
      "virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not\n",
      "much longer do they stand: there they already lie.\n",
      "Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "III. BACKWORLDSMEN.\n",
      "Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all\n",
      "backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world\n",
      "then seem to me.\n",
      "The dream—and diction—of a God, did the world then seem to me;\n",
      "coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.\n",
      "Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou—coloured vapours did\n",
      "they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away\n",
      "from himself,—thereupon he created the world.\n",
      "Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his\n",
      "suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did\n",
      "the world once seem to me.\n",
      "This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction’s image\n",
      "and imperfect image—an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:—thus\n",
      "did the world once seem to me.\n",
      "Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all\n",
      "backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?\n",
      "Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human\n",
      "madness, like all the Gods!\n",
      "A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine\n",
      "own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came\n",
      "not unto me from the beyond!\n",
      "What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I\n",
      "carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for\n",
      "myself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!\n",
      "To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to\n",
      "believe in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and\n",
      "humiliation. Thus speak I to backworldsmen.\n",
      "Suffering was it, and impotence—that created all backworlds; and the\n",
      "short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer\n",
      "experienceth.\n",
      "Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with a\n",
      "death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any\n",
      "longer: that created all Gods and backworlds.\n",
      "Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the\n",
      "body—it groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate\n",
      "walls.\n",
      "Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the\n",
      "earth—it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.\n",
      "And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its\n",
      "head—and not with its head only—into “the other world.”\n",
      "But that “other world” is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,\n",
      "inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence\n",
      "do not speak unto man, except as man.\n",
      "Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it\n",
      "speak. Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best\n",
      "proved?\n",
      "Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most\n",
      "uprightly of its being—this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is\n",
      "the measure and value of things.\n",
      "And this most upright existence, the ego—it speaketh of the body, and\n",
      "still implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth\n",
      "with broken wings.\n",
      "Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it\n",
      "learneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the\n",
      "earth.\n",
      "A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer\n",
      "to thrust one’s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it\n",
      "freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!\n",
      "A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath\n",
      "followed blindly, and to approve of it—and no longer to slink aside from\n",
      "it, like the sick and perishing!\n",
      "The sick and perishing—it was they who despised the body and the\n",
      "earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops;\n",
      "but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the\n",
      "earth!\n",
      "From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote\n",
      "for them. Then they sighed: “O that there were heavenly paths by which\n",
      "to steal into another existence and into happiness!” Then they contrived\n",
      "for themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!\n",
      "Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied\n",
      "themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe\n",
      "the convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this\n",
      "earth.\n",
      "Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant at\n",
      "their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become\n",
      "convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for\n",
      "themselves!\n",
      "Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh\n",
      "tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of\n",
      "his God; but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.\n",
      "Many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and\n",
      "languish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the\n",
      "latest of virtues, which is uprightness.\n",
      "Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were\n",
      "delusion and faith something different. Raving of the reason was\n",
      "likeness to God, and doubt was sin.\n",
      "Too well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed\n",
      "in, and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they\n",
      "themselves most believe in.\n",
      "Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body\n",
      "do they also believe most; and their own body is for them the\n",
      "thing-in-itself.\n",
      "But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of\n",
      "their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and\n",
      "themselves preach backworlds.\n",
      "Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is\n",
      "a more upright and pure voice.\n",
      "More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and\n",
      "square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "IV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.\n",
      "To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them\n",
      "neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to\n",
      "their own bodies,—and thus be dumb.\n",
      "“Body am I, and soul”—so saith the child. And why should one not\n",
      "speak like children?\n",
      "But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely,\n",
      "and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the\n",
      "body.”\n",
      "The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a\n",
      "peace, a flock and a shepherd.\n",
      "An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother,\n",
      "which thou callest “spirit”—a little instrument and plaything of thy big\n",
      "sagacity.\n",
      "“Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater\n",
      "thing—in which thou art unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big\n",
      "sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.\n",
      "What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its\n",
      "end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they\n",
      "are the end of all things: so vain are they.\n",
      "Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is\n",
      "still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it\n",
      "hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.\n",
      "Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth,\n",
      "conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.\n",
      "Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord,\n",
      "an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy\n",
      "body.\n",
      "There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who\n",
      "then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?\n",
      "Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. “What are\n",
      "these prancings and flights of thought unto me?” it saith to itself. “A\n",
      "by-way to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the\n",
      "prompter of its notions.”\n",
      "The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!” And thereupon it suffereth,\n",
      "and thinketh how it may put an end thereto—and for that very purpose it\n",
      "IS MEANT to think.\n",
      "The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!” Thereupon it rejoiceth,\n",
      "and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice—and for that very purpose it IS\n",
      "MEANT to think.\n",
      "To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise\n",
      "is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and\n",
      "despising and worth and will?\n",
      "The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it\n",
      "created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself\n",
      "spirit, as a hand to its will.\n",
      "Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye\n",
      "despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and\n",
      "turneth away from life.\n",
      "No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:—create beyond\n",
      "itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.\n",
      "But it is now too late to do so:—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye\n",
      "despisers of the body.\n",
      "To succumb—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become\n",
      "despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond\n",
      "yourselves.\n",
      "And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And\n",
      "unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.\n",
      "I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me\n",
      "to the Superman!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "V. JOYS AND PASSIONS.\n",
      "My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou\n",
      "hast it in common with no one.\n",
      "To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst\n",
      "pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.\n",
      "And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast\n",
      "become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!\n",
      "Better for thee to say: “Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is\n",
      "pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.”\n",
      "Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou\n",
      "must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.\n",
      "Thus speak and stammer: “That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth\n",
      "it please me entirely, thus only do I desire the good.\n",
      "Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human\n",
      "need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths\n",
      "and paradises.\n",
      "An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and\n",
      "the least everyday wisdom.\n",
      "But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish\n",
      "it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”\n",
      "Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.\n",
      "Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou\n",
      "only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.\n",
      "Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions:\n",
      "then became they thy virtues and joys.\n",
      "And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the\n",
      "voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;\n",
      "All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils\n",
      "angels.\n",
      "Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last\n",
      "into birds and charming songstresses.\n",
      "Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow,\n",
      "affliction, milkedst thou—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her\n",
      "udder.\n",
      "And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil\n",
      "that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.\n",
      "My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and\n",
      "no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.\n",
      "Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a\n",
      "one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was\n",
      "weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.\n",
      "My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil;\n",
      "necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the\n",
      "virtues.\n",
      "Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it\n",
      "wanteth thy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power,\n",
      "in wrath, hatred, and love.\n",
      "Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is\n",
      "jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.\n",
      "He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the\n",
      "scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.\n",
      "Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab\n",
      "itself?\n",
      "Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou\n",
      "love thy virtues,—for thou wilt succumb by them.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "VI. THE PALE CRIMINAL.\n",
      "Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal\n",
      "hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of\n",
      "his eye speaketh the great contempt.\n",
      "“Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me\n",
      "the great contempt of man”: so speaketh it out of that eye.\n",
      "When he judged himself—that was his supreme moment; let not the\n",
      "exalted one relapse again into his low estate!\n",
      "There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless\n",
      "it be speedy death.\n",
      "Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that\n",
      "ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!\n",
      "It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let\n",
      "your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own\n",
      "survival!\n",
      "“Enemy” shall ye say but not “villain,” “invalid” shall ye say but\n",
      "not “wretch,” “fool” shall ye say but not “sinner.”\n",
      "And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in\n",
      "thought, then would every one cry: “Away with the nastiness and the\n",
      "virulent reptile!”\n",
      "But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another\n",
      "thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll\n",
      "between them.\n",
      "An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he\n",
      "did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.\n",
      "Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I\n",
      "call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.\n",
      "The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck\n",
      "bewitched his weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.\n",
      "Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is\n",
      "BEFORE the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!\n",
      "Thus speaketh the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He\n",
      "meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not\n",
      "booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!\n",
      "But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded\n",
      "him. “What matter about blood!” it said; “wishest thou not, at least, to\n",
      "make booty thereby? Or take revenge?”\n",
      "And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon\n",
      "him—thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be ashamed\n",
      "of his madness.\n",
      "And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more\n",
      "is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.\n",
      "Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who\n",
      "shaketh that head?\n",
      "What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world\n",
      "through the spirit; there they want to get their prey.\n",
      "What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace\n",
      "among themselves—so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.\n",
      "Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul\n",
      "interpreted to itself—it interpreted it as murderous desire, and\n",
      "eagerness for the happiness of the knife.\n",
      "Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil:\n",
      "he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there\n",
      "have been other ages, and another evil and good.\n",
      "Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a\n",
      "heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to\n",
      "cause suffering.\n",
      "But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye\n",
      "tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!\n",
      "Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not\n",
      "their evil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed,\n",
      "like this pale criminal!\n",
      "Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or\n",
      "justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in\n",
      "wretched self-complacency.\n",
      "I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may\n",
      "grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "VII. READING AND WRITING.\n",
      "Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with\n",
      "his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is\n",
      "spirit.\n",
      "It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading\n",
      "idlers.\n",
      "He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another\n",
      "century of readers—and spirit itself will stink.\n",
      "Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not\n",
      "only writing but also thinking.\n",
      "Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh\n",
      "populace.\n",
      "He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but\n",
      "learnt by heart.\n",
      "In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that\n",
      "route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those\n",
      "spoken to should be big and tall.\n",
      "The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a\n",
      "joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.\n",
      "I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage\n",
      "which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins—it wanteth to\n",
      "laugh.\n",
      "I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see\n",
      "beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh—that is your\n",
      "thunder-cloud.\n",
      "Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward\n",
      "because I am exalted.\n",
      "Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?\n",
      "He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic\n",
      "plays and tragic realities.\n",
      "Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she\n",
      "is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.\n",
      "Ye tell me, “Life is hard to bear.” But for what purpose should ye\n",
      "have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?\n",
      "Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all\n",
      "of us fine sumpter asses and assesses.\n",
      "What have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a\n",
      "drop of dew hath formed upon it?\n",
      "It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because\n",
      "we are wont to love.\n",
      "There is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some\n",
      "method in madness.\n",
      "And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and\n",
      "soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit\n",
      "about—that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.\n",
      "I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.\n",
      "And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound,\n",
      "solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.\n",
      "Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the\n",
      "spirit of gravity!\n",
      "I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to\n",
      "fly; since then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.\n",
      "Now am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself. Now\n",
      "there danceth a God in me.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "VIII. THE TREE ON THE HILL.\n",
      "Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And\n",
      "as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town\n",
      "called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning\n",
      "against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley.\n",
      "Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat,\n",
      "and spake thus:\n",
      "“If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able\n",
      "to do so.\n",
      "But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it\n",
      "listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.”\n",
      "Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear\n",
      "Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra\n",
      "answered:\n",
      "“Why art thou frightened on that account?—But it is the same with man\n",
      "as with the tree.\n",
      "The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more\n",
      "vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and\n",
      "deep—into the evil.”\n",
      "“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou\n",
      "hast discovered my soul?”\n",
      "Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover,\n",
      "unless one first invent it.”\n",
      "“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more.\n",
      "“Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I\n",
      "sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how\n",
      "doth that happen?\n",
      "I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often\n",
      "overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps\n",
      "pardons me.\n",
      "When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the\n",
      "frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?\n",
      "My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber,\n",
      "the more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the\n",
      "height?\n",
      "How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my\n",
      "violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the\n",
      "height!”\n",
      "Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree\n",
      "beside which they stood, and spake thus:\n",
      "“This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high\n",
      "above man and beast.\n",
      "And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand\n",
      "it: so high hath it grown.\n",
      "Now it waiteth and waiteth,—for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too\n",
      "close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first\n",
      "lightning?”\n",
      "When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent\n",
      "gestures: “Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction I\n",
      "longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the\n",
      "lightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast\n",
      "appeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed\n",
      "me!”—Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put\n",
      "his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.\n",
      "And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak\n",
      "thus:\n",
      "It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes\n",
      "tell me all thy danger.\n",
      "As yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom. Too unslept\n",
      "hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.\n",
      "On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul.\n",
      "But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.\n",
      "Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when\n",
      "thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.\n",
      "Still art thou a prisoner—it seemeth to me—who deviseth liberty for\n",
      "himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also\n",
      "deceitful and wicked.\n",
      "To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit.\n",
      "Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his\n",
      "eye still to become.\n",
      "Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast\n",
      "not thy love and hope away!\n",
      "Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee\n",
      "still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this,\n",
      "that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.\n",
      "Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they\n",
      "call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.\n",
      "The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old,\n",
      "wanteth the good man, and that the old should be conserved.\n",
      "But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but\n",
      "lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.\n",
      "Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then\n",
      "they disparaged all high hopes.\n",
      "Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the\n",
      "day had hardly an aim.\n",
      "“Spirit is also voluptuousness,”—said they. Then broke the wings of\n",
      "their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it\n",
      "gnaweth.\n",
      "Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A\n",
      "trouble and a terror is the hero to them.\n",
      "But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy\n",
      "soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "IX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.\n",
      "There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom\n",
      "desistance from life must be preached.\n",
      "Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the\n",
      "many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the “life\n",
      "eternal”!\n",
      "“The yellow ones”: so are called the preachers of death, or “the\n",
      "black ones.” But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.\n",
      "There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast\n",
      "of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even\n",
      "their lusts are self-laceration.\n",
      "They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach\n",
      "desistance from life, and pass away themselves!\n",
      "There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when\n",
      "they begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and\n",
      "renunciation.\n",
      "They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let us\n",
      "beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living\n",
      "coffins!\n",
      "They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse—and immediately they\n",
      "say: “Life is refuted!”\n",
      "But they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only one aspect\n",
      "of existence.\n",
      "Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties\n",
      "that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.\n",
      "Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats, and mock at their childishness\n",
      "thereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their still\n",
      "clinging to it.\n",
      "Their wisdom speaketh thus: “A fool, he who remaineth alive; but so\n",
      "far are we fools! And that is the foolishest thing in life!”\n",
      "“Life is only suffering”: so say others, and lie not. Then see to it\n",
      "that YE cease! See to it that the life ceaseth which is only\n",
      "suffering!\n",
      "And let this be the teaching of your virtue: “Thou shalt slay\n",
      "thyself! Thou shalt steal away from thyself!”—\n",
      "“Lust is sin,”—so say some who preach death—“let us go apart and\n",
      "beget no children!”\n",
      "“Giving birth is troublesome,”—say others—“why still give birth? One\n",
      "beareth only the unfortunate!” And they also are preachers of death.\n",
      "“Pity is necessary,”—so saith a third party. “Take what I have! Take\n",
      "what I am! So much less doth life bind me!”\n",
      "Were they consistently pitiful, then would they make their neighbours\n",
      "sick of life. To be wicked—that would be their true goodness.\n",
      "But they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind others\n",
      "still faster with their chains and gifts!—\n",
      "And ye also, to whom life is rough labour and disquiet, are ye not\n",
      "very tired of life? Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?\n",
      "All ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, and\n",
      "strange—ye put up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and\n",
      "the will to self-forgetfulness.\n",
      "If ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves less to\n",
      "the momentary. But for waiting, ye have not enough of capacity in\n",
      "you—nor even for idling!\n",
      "Everywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death; and the\n",
      "earth is full of those to whom death hath to be preached.\n",
      "Or “life eternal”; it is all the same to me—if only they pass away\n",
      "quickly!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "X. WAR AND WARRIORS.\n",
      "By our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either\n",
      "whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!\n",
      "My brethren in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was\n",
      "ever, your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell\n",
      "you the truth!\n",
      "I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great enough\n",
      "not to know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed\n",

      "than the long.\n",
      "You I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace,\n",

      "“What is good?” ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls\n",
      "say: “To be good is what is pretty, and at the same time touching.”\n",
      "They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love the\n",
      "bashfulness of your good-will. Ye are ashamed of your flow, and others\n",

      "in your sublimity there is wickedness. I know you.\n",

      "Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my\n",
      "brethren: here there are states.\n",
      "A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for now will\n",
      "I say unto you my word concerning the death of peoples.\n",
      "A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it\n",
      "also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: “I, the state, am the\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith\n",
      "and a love over them: thus they served life.\n",
      "Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state:\n",
      "they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.\n",
      "Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but\n",
      "hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.\n",
      "This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of good\n",
      "and evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language hath it\n",
      "devised for itself in laws and customs.\n",
      "But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever\n",
      "it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.\n",
      "False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the biting\n",
      "one. False are even its bowels.\n",
      "Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto you as\n",
      "the sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this sign!\n",
      "Verily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!\n",
      "Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state\n",
      "devised!\n",

      "Ah! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy lies!\n",

      "themselves!\n",
      "Yea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! Weary ye\n",

      "ofttimes also the throne on filth.\n",
      "Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Badly\n",

      "not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?—\n",

      "XII. THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE.\n",
      "Flee, my friend, into thy solitude! I see thee deafened with the\n",
      "noise of the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little\n",
      "ones.\n",
      "Admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee.\n",
      "Resemble again the tree which thou lovest, the broad-branched\n",
      "one—silently and attentively it o’erhangeth the sea.\n",
      "Where solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where\n",
      "the market-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great\n",
      "actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.\n",
      "In the world even the best things are worthless without those who\n",
      "represent them: those representers, the people call great men.\n",
      "Little do the people understand what is great—that is to say, the\n",
      "creating agency. But they have a taste for all representers and actors\n",
      "of great things.\n",
      "Around the devisers of new values revolveth the world:—invisibly it\n",
      "revolveth. But around the actors revolve the people and the glory: such\n",
      "is the course of things.\n",
      "Spirit, hath the actor, but little conscience of the spirit. He\n",
      "believeth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most strongly—in\n",
      "HIMSELF!\n",
      "To-morrow he hath a new belief, and the day after, one still newer.\n",
      "Sharp perceptions hath he, like the people, and changeable humours.\n",
      "To upset—that meaneth with him to prove. To drive mad—that meaneth\n",

      "Thou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow by the\n",
      "numerous drops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops.\n",
      "Exhausted I see thee, by poisonous flies; bleeding I see thee, and\n",
      "torn at a hundred spots; and thy pride will not even upbraid.\n",
      "Blood they would have from thee in all innocence; blood their\n",

      "innocence.\n",
      "But thou, profound one, thou sufferest too profoundly even from small\n",

      "be thy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice!\n",

      "They flatter thee, as one flattereth a God or devil; they whimper\n",
      "before thee, as before a God or devil. What doth it come to! Flatterers\n",
      "are they, and whimperers, and nothing more.\n",
      "Often, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. But\n",
      "that hath ever been the prudence of the cowardly. Yea! the cowardly are\n",
      "wise!\n",
      "They think much about thee with their circumscribed souls—thou art\n",
      "always suspected by them! Whatever is much thought about is at last\n",
      "thought suspicious.\n",
      "They punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in their\n",
      "inmost hearts only—for thine errors.\n",
      "Because thou art gentle and of upright character, thou sayest:\n",
      "“Blameless are they for their small existence.” But their circumscribed\n",
      "souls think: “Blamable is all great existence.”\n",
      "Even when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel themselves\n",

      "your guard against the small ones!\n",
      "In thy presence they feel themselves small, and their baseness\n",
      "gleameth and gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance.\n",
      "Sawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou approachedst\n",
      "them, and how their energy left them like the smoke of an extinguishing\n",
      "fire?\n",
      "Yea, my friend, the bad conscience art thou of thy neighbours; for\n",
      "they are unworthy of thee. Therefore they hate thee, and would fain suck\n",
      "thy blood.\n",
      "Thy neighbours will always be poisonous flies; what is great in\n",

      "breeze bloweth. It is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.—\n",

      "XIII. CHASTITY.\n",
      "I love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too\n",
      "many of the lustful.\n",
      "Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the\n",
      "dreams of a lustful woman?\n",
      "And just look at these men: their eye saith it—they know nothing\n",
      "better on earth than to lie with a woman.\n",
      "Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath\n",
      "still spirit in it!\n",
      "Would that ye were perfect—at least as animals! But to animals\n",
      "belongeth innocence.\n",
      "Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence\n",
      "in your instincts.\n",
      "Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but\n",
      "with many almost a vice.\n",
      "These are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh enviously\n",
      "out of all that they do.\n",
      "Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth\n",
      "this creature follow them, with its discord.\n",
      "And how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a\n",
      "piece of flesh is denied it!\n",
      "Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am\n",
      "distrustful of your doggish lust.\n",
      "Ye have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers.\n",
      "Hath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of\n",
      "fellow-suffering?\n",
      "And also this parable give I unto you: Not a few who meant to cast\n",
      "out their devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.\n",
      "To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become\n",
      "the road to hell—to filth and lust of soul.\n",
      "Do I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to\n",
      "do.\n",
      "Not when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the\n",
      "discerning one go unwillingly into its waters.\n",
      "Verily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they are\n",
      "gentler of heart, and laugh better and oftener than you.\n",
      "They laugh also at chastity, and ask: “What is chastity?\n",
      "Is chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we unto\n",
      "it.\n",
      "We offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth with us—let\n",
      "it stay as long as it will!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XIV. THE FRIEND.\n",
      "“One, is always too many about me”—thinketh the anchorite. “Always\n",
      "once one—that maketh two in the long run!”\n",
      "I and me are always too earnestly in conversation: how could it be\n",
      "endured, if there were not a friend?\n",
      "The friend of the anchorite is always the third one: the third one is\n",
      "the cork which preventeth the conversation of the two sinking into the\n",
      "depth.\n",
      "Ah! there are too many depths for all anchorites. Therefore, do they\n",
      "long so much for a friend, and for his elevation.\n",
      "Our faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have faith in\n",
      "ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.\n",
      "And often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. And often we\n",
      "attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are\n",
      "vulnerable.\n",
      "“Be at least mine enemy!”—thus speaketh the true reverence, which\n",
      "doth not venture to solicit friendship.\n",
      "If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing to wage war\n",
      "for him: and in order to wage war, one must be CAPABLE of being an\n",
      "enemy.\n",
      "One ought still to honour the enemy in one’s friend. Canst thou go\n",
      "nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him?\n",
      "In one’s friend one shall have one’s best enemy. Thou shalt be\n",
      "closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.\n",
      "Thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in honour of\n",
      "thy friend that thou showest thyself to him as thou art? But he wisheth\n",
      "thee to the devil on that account!\n",
      "He who maketh no secret of himself shocketh: so much reason have ye\n",
      "to fear nakedness! Aye, if ye were Gods, ye could then be ashamed of\n",
      "clothing!\n",
      "Thou canst not adorn thyself fine enough for thy friend; for thou\n",
      "shalt be unto him an arrow and a longing for the Superman.\n",
      "Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep—to know how he looketh? What is\n",
      "usually the countenance of thy friend? It is thine own countenance, in a\n",
      "coarse and imperfect mirror.\n",
      "Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep? Wert thou not dismayed at thy\n",
      "friend looking so? O my friend, man is something that hath to be\n",
      "surpassed.\n",
      "In divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: not\n",
      "everything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall disclose unto thee\n",
      "what thy friend doeth when awake.\n",
      "Let thy pity be a divining: to know first if thy friend wanteth pity.\n",
      "Perhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.\n",
      "Let thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell; thou shalt\n",
      "bite out a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and sweetness.\n",
      "Art thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to thy friend?\n",
      "Many a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his\n",
      "friend’s emancipator.\n",
      "Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant?\n",
      "Then thou canst not have friends.\n",
      "Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman.\n",
      "On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only\n",
      "love.\n",
      "In woman’s love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not\n",
      "love. And even in woman’s conscious love, there is still always surprise\n",
      "and lightning and night, along with the light.\n",
      "As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and\n",
      "birds. Or at the best, cows.\n",
      "As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, ye men, who\n",
      "of you are capable of friendship?\n",
      "Oh! your poverty, ye men, and your sordidness of soul! As much as ye\n",
      "give to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have\n",
      "become poorer thereby.\n",
      "There is comradeship: may there be friendship!\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.\n",
      "Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he discovered the\n",
      "good and bad of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on\n",
      "earth than good and bad.\n",
      "No people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain\n",
      "itself, however, it must not value as its neighbour valueth.\n",
      "Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and\n",
      "contempt by another: thus I found it. Much found I here called bad,\n",
      "which was there decked with purple honours.\n",
      "Never did the one neighbour understand the other: ever did his soul\n",

      "A table of excellencies hangeth over every people. Lo! it is the\n",
      "table of their triumphs; lo! it is the voice of their Will to Power.\n",
      "It is laudable, what they think hard; what is indispensable and hard\n",
      "they call good; and what relieveth in the direst distress, the unique\n",
      "and hardest of all,—they extol as holy.\n",
      "Whatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine, to the dismay and\n",
      "envy of their neighbours, they regard as the high and foremost thing,\n",
      "the test and the meaning of all else.\n",
      "Verily, my brother, if thou knewest but a people’s need, its land,\n",
      "its sky, and its neighbour, then wouldst thou divine the law of its\n",

      "“Always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above others: no one\n",

      "“To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow”—so seemed it\n",
      "alike pleasing and hard to the people from whom cometh my name—the name\n",
      "which is alike pleasing and hard to me.\n",
      "“To honour father and mother, and from the root of the soul to do\n",

      "blood, even in evil and dangerous courses”—teaching itself so, another\n",
      "people mastered itself, and thus mastering itself, became pregnant and\n",
      "heavy with great hopes.\n",
      "Verily, men have given unto themselves all their good and bad.\n",
      "Verily, they took it not, they found it not, it came not unto them as a\n",
      "voice from heaven.\n",
      "Values did man only assign to things in order to maintain himself—he\n",
      "created only the significance of things, a human significance!\n",
      "Therefore, calleth he himself “man,” that is, the valuator.\n",
      "Valuing is creating: hear it, ye creating ones! Valuation itself is\n",
      "the treasure and jewel of the valued things.\n",
      "Through valuation only is there value; and without valuation the nut\n",

      "A thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand peoples\n",

      "lacking, is there not also still lacking—humanity itself?—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XVI. NEIGHBOUR-LOVE.\n",
      "Ye crowd around your neighbour, and have fine words for it. But I say\n",
      "unto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of yourselves.\n",
      "Ye flee unto your neighbour from yourselves, and would fain make a\n",
      "virtue thereof: but I fathom your “unselfishness.”\n",
      "The THOU is older than the I; the THOU hath been\n",
      "consecrated, but not yet the I: so man presseth nigh unto his\n",
      "neighbour.\n",
      "Do I advise you to neighbour-love? Rather do I advise you to\n",
      "neighbour-flight and to furthest love!\n",
      "Higher than love to your neighbour is love to the furthest and future\n",
      "ones; higher still than love to men, is love to things and phantoms.\n",
      "The phantom that runneth on before thee, my brother, is fairer than\n",
      "thou; why dost thou not give unto it thy flesh and thy bones? But thou\n",
      "fearest, and runnest unto thy neighbour.\n",
      "Ye cannot endure it with yourselves, and do not love yourselves\n",
      "sufficiently: so ye seek to mislead your neighbour into love, and would\n",
      "fain gild yourselves with his error.\n",
      "Would that ye could not endure it with any kind of near ones, or\n",
      "their neighbours; then would ye have to create your friend and his\n",
      "overflowing heart out of yourselves.\n",
      "Ye call in a witness when ye want to speak well of yourselves; and\n",
      "when ye have misled him to think well of you, ye also think well of\n",
      "yourselves.\n",
      "Not only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowledge, but\n",
      "more so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. And thus speak ye of\n",
      "yourselves in your intercourse, and belie your neighbour with\n",
      "yourselves.\n",
      "Thus saith the fool: “Association with men spoileth the character,\n",
      "especially when one hath none.”\n",
      "The one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh himself, and the\n",
      "other because he would fain lose himself. Your bad love to yourselves\n",
      "maketh solitude a prison to you.\n",
      "The furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the near ones;\n",
      "and when there are but five of you together, a sixth must always\n",
      "die.\n",
      "I love not your festivals either: too many actors found I there, and\n",
      "even the spectators often behaved like actors.\n",
      "Not the neighbour do I teach you, but the friend. Let the friend be\n",
      "the festival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of the Superman.\n",
      "I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one must know\n",
      "how to be a sponge, if one would be loved by overflowing hearts.\n",
      "I teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete, a capsule\n",
      "of the good,—the creating friend, who hath always a complete world to\n",
      "bestow.\n",
      "And as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolleth it together\n",
      "again for him in rings, as the growth of good through evil, as the\n",
      "growth of purpose out of chance.\n",
      "Let the future and the furthest be the motive of thy to-day; in thy\n",
      "friend shalt thou love the Superman as thy motive.\n",
      "My brethren, I advise you not to neighbour-love—I advise you to\n",
      "furthest love!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XVII. THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE.\n",
      "Wouldst thou go into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thou seek the way\n",
      "unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto me.\n",
      "“He who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation is wrong”:\n",
      "so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.\n",
      "The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou sayest,\n",
      "“I have no longer a conscience in common with you,” then will it be a\n",
      "plaint and a pain.\n",
      "Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and the last\n",
      "gleam of that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction.\n",
      "But thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the way\n",
      "unto thyself? Then show me thine authority and thy strength to do\n",
      "so!\n",
      "Art thou a new strength and a new authority? A first motion? A\n",
      "self-rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars to revolve around\n",
      "thee?\n",
      "Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so many\n",
      "convulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not a lusting and\n",
      "ambitious one!\n",
      "Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the\n",
      "bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever.\n",
      "Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and\n",
      "not that thou hast escaped from a yoke.\n",
      "Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast\n",
      "away his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.\n",
      "Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly,\n",
      "however, shall thine eye show unto me: free FOR WHAT?\n",
      "Canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set up thy\n",
      "will as a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, and avenger of\n",
      "thy law?\n",
      "Terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one’s own law.\n",
      "Thus is a star projected into desert space, and into the icy breath of\n",
      "aloneness.\n",
      "To-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individual;\n",
      "to-day hast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes.\n",
      "But one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy pride\n",
      "yield, and thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: “I am alone!”\n",
      "One day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too closely\n",
      "thy lowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom.\n",
      "Thou wilt one day cry: “All is false!”\n",
      "There are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if they do\n",
      "not succeed, then must they themselves die! But art thou capable of\n",
      "it—to be a murderer?\n",
      "Hast thou ever known, my brother, the word “disdain”? And the anguish\n",
      "of thy justice in being just to those that disdain thee?\n",
      "Thou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, charge they\n",
      "heavily to thine account. Thou camest nigh unto them, and yet wentest\n",
      "past: for that they never forgive thee.\n",
      "Thou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the smaller doth\n",
      "the eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is the flying one\n",
      "hated.\n",
      "“How could ye be just unto me!”—must thou say—“I choose your\n",
      "injustice as my allotted portion.”\n",
      "Injustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one: but, my brother,\n",
      "if thou wouldst be a star, thou must shine for them none the less on\n",
      "that account!\n",
      "And be on thy guard against the good and just! They would fain\n",
      "crucify those who devise their own virtue—they hate the lonesome\n",
      "ones.\n",
      "Be on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy to it\n",
      "that is not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the fire—of the\n",
      "fagot and stake.\n",
      "And be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! Too\n",
      "readily doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who meeteth him.\n",
      "To many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy paw; and I\n",
      "wish thy paw also to have claws.\n",
      "But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself always be;\n",
      "thou waylayest thyself in caverns and forests.\n",
      "Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And past thyself\n",
      "and thy seven devils leadeth thy way!\n",
      "A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a soothsayer, and\n",
      "a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.\n",
      "Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how couldst\n",
      "thou become new if thou have not first become ashes!\n",
      "Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one: a God wilt\n",
      "thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils!\n",
      "Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: thou lovest\n",
      "thyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, as only the loving\n",
      "ones despise.\n",
      "To create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! What\n",
      "knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he\n",
      "loved!\n",
      "With thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with thy\n",
      "creating; and late only will justice limp after thee.\n",
      "With my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love him who\n",
      "seeketh to create beyond himself, and thus succumbeth.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.\n",
      "“Why stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra?\n",
      "And what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle?\n",
      "Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that hath been\n",
      "born thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief’s errand, thou friend of the\n",
      "evil?”—\n",
      "Verily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that hath been\n",
      "given me: it is a little truth which I carry.\n",
      "But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its mouth,\n",
      "it screameth too loudly.\n",
      "As I went on my way alone to-day, at the hour when the sun declineth,\n",
      "there met me an old woman, and she spake thus unto my soul:\n",
      "“Much hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spake he\n",
      "unto us concerning woman.”\n",
      "And I answered her: “Concerning woman, one should only talk unto\n",
      "men.”\n",
      "“Talk also unto me of woman,” said she; “I am old enough to forget it\n",
      "presently.”\n",
      "And I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her:\n",
      "Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman hath one\n",
      "solution—it is called pregnancy.\n",
      "Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what\n",
      "is woman for man?\n",
      "Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion.\n",
      "Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\n",
      "Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the\n",
      "warrior: all else is folly.\n",
      "Too sweet fruits—these the warrior liketh not. Therefore liketh he\n",
      "woman;—bitter is even the sweetest woman.\n",
      "Better than man doth woman understand children, but man is more\n",
      "childish than woman.\n",
      "In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then,\n",
      "ye women, and discover the child in man!\n",
      "A plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious stone,\n",
      "illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.\n",
      "Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: “May I\n",
      "bear the Superman!”\n",
      "In your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye assail him\n",
      "who inspireth you with fear!\n",
      "In your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand otherwise\n",
      "about honour. But let this be your honour: always to love more than ye\n",
      "are loved, and never be the second.\n",
      "Let man fear woman when she loveth: then maketh she every sacrifice,\n",
      "and everything else she regardeth as worthless.\n",
      "Let man fear woman when she hateth: for man in his innermost soul is\n",
      "merely evil; woman, however, is mean.\n",
      "Whom hateth woman most?—Thus spake the iron to the loadstone: “I hate\n",
      "thee most, because thou attractest, but art too weak to draw unto\n",
      "thee.”\n",
      "The happiness of man is, “I will.” The happiness of woman is, “He\n",
      "will.”\n",
      "“Lo! now hath the world become perfect!”—thus thinketh every woman\n",
      "when she obeyeth with all her love.\n",
      "Obey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. Surface, is\n",
      "woman’s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow water.\n",
      "Man’s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subterranean\n",
      "caverns: woman surmiseth its force, but comprehendeth it not.—\n",
      "Then answered me the old woman: “Many fine things hath Zarathustra\n",
      "said, especially for those who are young enough for them.\n",
      "Strange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet he is right\n",
      "about them! Doth this happen, because with women nothing is\n",
      "impossible?\n",
      "And now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old enough for\n",
      "it!\n",
      "Swaddle it up and hold its mouth: otherwise it will scream too\n",
      "loudly, the little truth.”\n",
      "“Give me, woman, thy little truth!” said I. And thus spake the old\n",
      "woman:\n",
      "“Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XIX. THE BITE OF THE ADDER.\n",
      "One day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the\n",
      "heat, with his arms over his face. And there came an adder and bit him\n",
      "in the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed with pain. When he had taken\n",
      "his arm from his face he looked at the serpent; and then did it\n",
      "recognise the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get\n",
      "away. “Not at all,” said Zarathustra, “as yet hast thou not received my\n",
      "thanks! Thou hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.” “Thy\n",
      "journey is short,” said the adder sadly; “my poison is fatal.”\n",
      "Zarathustra smiled. “When did ever a dragon die of a serpent’s\n",
      "poison?”—said he. “But take thy poison back! Thou art not rich enough to\n",
      "present it to me.” Then fell the adder again on his neck, and licked his\n",
      "wound.\n",
      "When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him: “And\n",
      "what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?” And Zarathustra\n",
      "answered them thus:\n",
      "The destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my story is\n",
      "immoral.\n",
      "When, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not good for evil:\n",
      "for that would abash him. But prove that he hath done something good to\n",
      "you.\n",
      "And rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are cursed, it\n",
      "pleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. Rather curse a\n",
      "little also!\n",
      "And should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five small\n",
      "ones besides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice presseth\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "Did ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And he who\n",
      "can bear it, shall take the injustice upon himself!\n",
      "A small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if the\n",
      "punishment be not also a right and an honour to the transgressor, I do\n",
      "not like your punishing.\n",
      "Nobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish one’s\n",
      "right, especially if one be in the right. Only, one must be rich enough\n",
      "to do so.\n",
      "I do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges there\n",
      "always glanceth the executioner and his cold steel.\n",
      "Tell me: where find we justice, which is love with seeing eyes?\n",
      "Devise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punishment, but\n",
      "also all guilt!\n",
      "Devise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one except the\n",
      "judge!\n",
      "And would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be just from\n",
      "the heart, even the lie becometh philanthropy.\n",
      "But how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every one his\n",
      "own! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one mine own.\n",
      "Finally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any anchorite. How\n",
      "could an anchorite forget! How could he requite!\n",
      "Like a deep well is an anchorite. Easy is it to throw in a stone: if\n",
      "it should sink to the bottom, however, tell me, who will bring it out\n",
      "again?\n",
      "Guard against injuring the anchorite! If ye have done so, however,\n",
      "well then, kill him also!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.\n",
      "I have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead,\n",
      "cast I this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth.\n",
      "Thou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I ask thee: Art\n",
      "thou a man ENTITLED to desire a child?\n",
      "Art thou the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of thy\n",
      "passions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee.\n",
      "Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or isolation? Or\n",
      "discord in thee?\n",
      "I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. Living\n",
      "monuments shalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation.\n",
      "Beyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou be built\n",
      "thyself, rectangular in body and soul.\n",
      "Not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! For that\n",
      "purpose may the garden of marriage help thee!\n",
      "A higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spontaneously\n",
      "rolling wheel—a creating one shalt thou create.\n",
      "Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is\n",
      "more than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those\n",
      "exercising such a will, call I marriage.\n",
      "Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. But that\n",
      "which the many-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones—ah, what\n",
      "shall I call it?\n",
      "Ah, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in the\n",
      "twain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain!\n",

      "heaven.\n",
      "Well, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not\n",
      "like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils!\n",
      "Far from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless what he hath\n",
      "not matched!\n",
      "Laugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason to weep\n",
      "over its parents?\n",
      "Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but\n",
      "when I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps.\n",
      "Yea, I would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a\n",
      "goose mate with one another.\n",
      "This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for\n",
      "himself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it.\n",
      "That one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. But one time\n",
      "he spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calleth it.\n",
      "Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But all at\n",
      "once he became the handmaid of a woman, and now would he need also to\n",
      "become an angel.\n",
      "Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes.\n",
      "But even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack.\n",
      "Many short follies—that is called love by you. And your marriage\n",
      "putteth an end to many short follies, with one long stupidity.\n",
      "Your love to woman, and woman’s love to man—ah, would that it were\n",
      "sympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But generally two animals\n",
      "alight on one another.\n",

      "love. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your\n",
      "love.\n",

      "Holy call I such a will, and such a marriage.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.\n",
      "Many die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange soundeth the\n",
      "precept: “Die at the right time!”\n",
      "Die at the right time: so teacheth Zarathustra.\n",
      "To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever\n",
      "die at the right time? Would that he might never be born!—Thus do I\n",
      "advise the superfluous ones.\n",
      "But even the superfluous ones make much ado about their death, and\n",
      "even the hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked.\n",
      "Every one regardeth dying as a great matter: but as yet death is not\n",
      "a festival. Not yet have people learned to inaugurate the finest\n",
      "festivals.\n",
      "The consummating death I show unto you, which becometh a stimulus and\n",
      "promise to the living.\n",
      "His death, dieth the consummating one triumphantly, surrounded by\n",
      "hoping and promising ones.\n",
      "Thus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival at\n",
      "which such a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the living!\n",
      "Thus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, and\n",
      "sacrifice a great soul.\n",
      "But to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor, is your grinning\n",
      "death which stealeth nigh like a thief,—and yet cometh as master.\n",
      "My death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which cometh unto\n",
      "me because I want it.\n",
      "And when shall I want it?—He that hath a goal and an heir, wanteth\n",
      "death at the right time for the goal and the heir.\n",
      "And out of reverence for the goal and the heir, he will hang up no\n",
      "more withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.\n",
      "Verily, not the rope-makers will I resemble: they lengthen out their\n",
      "cord, and thereby go ever backward.\n",
      "Many a one, also, waxeth too old for his truths and triumphs; a\n",
      "toothless mouth hath no longer the right to every truth.\n",
      "And whoever wanteth to have fame, must take leave of honour betimes,\n",
      "and practise the difficult art of—going at the right time.\n",
      "One must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth best: that\n",
      "is known by those who want to be long loved.\n",
      "Sour apples are there, no doubt, whose lot is to wait until the last\n",
      "day of autumn: and at the same time they become ripe, yellow, and\n",
      "shrivelled.\n",
      "In some ageth the heart first, and in others the spirit. And some are\n",
      "hoary in youth, but the late young keep long young.\n",
      "To many men life is a failure; a poison-worm gnaweth at their heart.\n",
      "Then let them see to it that their dying is all the more a success.\n",
      "Many never become sweet; they rot even in the summer. It is cowardice\n",
      "that holdeth them fast to their branches.\n",
      "Far too many live, and far too long hang they on their branches.\n",
      "Would that a storm came and shook all this rottenness and worm-eatenness\n",
      "from the tree!\n",
      "Would that there came preachers of SPEEDY death! Those would be the\n",
      "appropriate storms and agitators of the trees of life! But I hear only\n",
      "slow death preached, and patience with all that is “earthly.”\n",
      "Ah! ye preach patience with what is earthly? This earthly is it that\n",
      "hath too much patience with you, ye blasphemers!\n",
      "Verily, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death\n",
      "honour: and to many hath it proved a calamity that he died too\n",
      "early.\n",
      "As yet had he known only tears, and the melancholy of the Hebrews,\n",
      "together with the hatred of the good and just—the Hebrew Jesus: then was\n",
      "he seized with the longing for death.\n",
      "Had he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the good and\n",
      "just! Then, perhaps, would he have learned to live, and love the\n",
      "earth—and laughter also!\n",
      "Believe it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would have\n",
      "disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble enough was he to\n",
      "disavow!\n",
      "But he was still immature. Immaturely loveth the youth, and\n",
      "immaturely also hateth he man and earth. Confined and awkward are still\n",
      "his soul and the wings of his spirit.\n",
      "But in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less of\n",
      "melancholy: better understandeth he about life and death.\n",
      "Free for death, and free in death; a holy Naysayer, when there is no\n",
      "longer time for Yea: thus understandeth he about death and life.\n",
      "That your dying may not be a reproach to man and the earth, my\n",
      "friends: that do I solicit from the honey of your soul.\n",
      "In your dying shall your spirit and your virtue still shine like an\n",
      "evening after-glow around the earth: otherwise your dying hath been\n",
      "unsatisfactory.\n",
      "Thus will I die myself, that ye friends may love the earth more for\n",
      "my sake; and earth will I again become, to have rest in her that bore\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Verily, a goal had Zarathustra; he threw his ball. Now be ye friends\n",
      "the heirs of my goal; to you throw I the golden ball.\n",
      "Best of all, do I see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! And so\n",
      "tarry I still a little while on the earth—pardon me for it!\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXII. THE BESTOWING VIRTUE.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "When Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was\n",
      "attached, the name of which is “The Pied Cow,” there followed him many\n",
      "people who called themselves his disciples, and kept him company. Thus\n",
      "came they to a crossroad. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted\n",
      "to go alone; for he was fond of going alone. His disciples, however,\n",
      "presented him at his departure with a staff, on the golden handle of\n",
      "which a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of\n",
      "the staff, and supported himself thereon; then spake he thus to his\n",
      "disciples:\n",
      "Tell me, pray: how came gold to the highest value? Because it is\n",
      "uncommon, and unprofiting, and beaming, and soft in lustre; it always\n",
      "bestoweth itself.\n",
      "Only as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest value.\n",
      "Goldlike, beameth the glance of the bestower. Gold-lustre maketh peace\n",
      "between moon and sun.\n",
      "Uncommon is the highest virtue, and unprofiting, beaming is it, and\n",
      "soft of lustre: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.\n",
      "Verily, I divine you well, my disciples: ye strive like me for the\n",
      "bestowing virtue. What should ye have in common with cats and\n",
      "wolves?\n",
      "It is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and\n",
      "therefore have ye the thirst to accumulate all riches in your soul.\n",
      "Insatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels, because your\n",
      "virtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow.\n",
      "Ye constrain all things to flow towards you and into you, so that\n",
      "they shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your\n",
      "love.\n",
      "Verily, an appropriator of all values must such bestowing love\n",
      "become; but healthy and holy, call I this selfishness.—\n",
      "Another selfishness is there, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which\n",
      "would always steal—the selfishness of the sick, the sickly\n",
      "selfishness.\n",
      "With the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous; with\n",
      "the craving of hunger it measureth him who hath abundance; and ever doth\n",
      "it prowl round the tables of bestowers.\n",
      "Sickness speaketh in such craving, and invisible degeneration; of a\n",
      "sickly body, speaketh the larcenous craving of this selfishness.\n",
      "Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it\n",
      "not DEGENERATION?—And we always suspect degeneration when the bestowing\n",
      "soul is lacking.\n",
      "Upward goeth our course from genera on to super-genera. But a horror\n",
      "to us is the degenerating sense, which saith: “All for myself.”\n",
      "Upward soareth our sense: thus is it a simile of our body, a simile\n",
      "of an elevation. Such similes of elevations are the names of the\n",
      "virtues.\n",
      "Thus goeth the body through history, a becomer and fighter. And the\n",
      "spirit—what is it to the body? Its fights’ and victories’ herald, its\n",
      "companion and echo.\n",
      "Similes, are all names of good and evil; they do not speak out, they\n",
      "only hint. A fool who seeketh knowledge from them!\n",
      "Give heed, my brethren, to every hour when your spirit would speak in\n",
      "similes: there is the origin of your virtue.\n",
      "Elevated is then your body, and raised up; with its delight,\n",
      "enraptureth it the spirit; so that it becometh creator, and valuer, and\n",
      "lover, and everything’s benefactor.\n",
      "When your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, a blessing\n",
      "and a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin of your virtue.\n",
      "When ye are exalted above praise and blame, and your will would\n",
      "command all things, as a loving one’s will: there is the origin of your\n",
      "virtue.\n",
      "When ye despise pleasant things, and the effeminate couch, and cannot\n",
      "couch far enough from the effeminate: there is the origin of your\n",
      "virtue.\n",
      "When ye are willers of one will, and when that change of every need\n",
      "is needful to you: there is the origin of your virtue.\n",
      "Verily, a new good and evil is it! Verily, a new deep murmuring, and\n",
      "the voice of a new fountain!\n",
      "Power is it, this new virtue; a ruling thought is it, and around it a\n",
      "subtle soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Here paused Zarathustra awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.\n",
      "Then he continued to speak thus—and his voice had changed:\n",
      "Remain true to the earth, my brethren, with the power of your virtue!\n",
      "Let your bestowing love and your knowledge be devoted to be the meaning\n",
      "of the earth! Thus do I pray and conjure you.\n",
      "Let it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal walls\n",
      "with its wings! Ah, there hath always been so much flown-away\n",
      "virtue!\n",
      "Lead, like me, the flown-away virtue back to the earth—yea, back to\n",
      "body and life: that it may give to the earth its meaning, a human\n",
      "meaning!\n",
      "A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown away and\n",
      "blundered. Alas! in our body dwelleth still all this delusion and\n",
      "blundering: body and will hath it there become.\n",
      "A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue attempted and\n",
      "erred. Yea, an attempt hath man been. Alas, much ignorance and error\n",
      "hath become embodied in us!\n",
      "Not only the rationality of millenniums—also their madness, breaketh\n",
      "out in us. Dangerous is it to be an heir.\n",
      "Still fight we step by step with the giant Chance, and over all\n",
      "mankind hath hitherto ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.\n",
      "Let your spirit and your virtue be devoted to the sense of the earth,\n",
      "my brethren: let the value of everything be determined anew by you!\n",
      "Therefore shall ye be fighters! Therefore shall ye be creators!\n",
      "Intelligently doth the body purify itself; attempting with\n",
      "intelligence it exalteth itself; to the discerners all impulses sanctify\n",
      "themselves; to the exalted the soul becometh joyful.\n",
      "Physician, heal thyself: then wilt thou also heal thy patient. Let it\n",
      "be his best cure to see with his eyes him who maketh himself whole.\n",
      "A thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a\n",
      "thousand salubrities and hidden islands of life. Unexhausted and\n",
      "undiscovered is still man and man’s world.\n",
      "Awake and hearken, ye lonesome ones! From the future come winds with\n",
      "stealthy pinions, and to fine ears good tidings are proclaimed.\n",
      "Ye lonesome ones of to-day, ye seceding ones, ye shall one day be a\n",
      "people: out of you who have chosen yourselves, shall a chosen people\n",
      "arise:—and out of it the Superman.\n",
      "Verily, a place of healing shall the earth become! And already is a\n",
      "new odour diffused around it, a salvation-bringing odour—and a new\n",
      "hope!\n",
      "3.\n",
      "When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had\n",
      "not said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in\n",
      "his hand. At last he spake thus—and his voice had changed:\n",
      "I now go alone, my disciples! Ye also now go away, and alone! So will\n",
      "I have it.\n",
      "Verily, I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against\n",
      "Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he hath\n",
      "deceived you.\n",
      "The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but\n",
      "also to hate his friends.\n",
      "One requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a scholar. And why\n",
      "will ye not pluck at my wreath?\n",
      "Ye venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day collapse?\n",
      "Take heed lest a statue crush you!\n",
      "Ye say, ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is\n",
      "Zarathustra! Ye are my believers: but of what account are all\n",
      "believers!\n",
      "Ye had not yet sought yourselves: then did ye find me. So do all\n",
      "believers; therefore all belief is of so little account.\n",
      "Now do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have\n",
      "all denied me, will I return unto you.\n",
      "Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones;\n",
      "with another love shall I then love you.\n",
      "And once again shall ye have become friends unto me, and children of\n",
      "one hope: then will I be with you for the third time, to celebrate the\n",
      "great noontide with you.\n",
      "And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course\n",
      "between animal and Superman, and celebrateth his advance to the evening\n",
      "as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.\n",

      "Bestowing Virtue.”\n",
      "XXIII. THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR.\n",
      "After this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the\n",
      "solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a\n",
      "sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient\n",
      "and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much\n",
      "to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of\n",
      "love, and keep modest as a giver.\n",
      "Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom\n",
      "meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.\n",
      "One morning, however, he awoke ere the rosy dawn, and having\n",
      "meditated long on his couch, at last spake thus to his heart:\n",
      "Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come\n",
      "to me, carrying a mirror?\n",
      "“O Zarathustra”—said the child unto me—“look at thyself in the\n",
      "mirror!”\n",
      "But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed:\n",
      "for not myself did I see therein, but a devil’s grimace and\n",
      "derision.\n",
      "Verily, all too well do I understand the dream’s portent and\n",
      "monition: my DOCTRINE is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!\n",
      "Mine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of\n",
      "my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I\n",
      "gave them.\n",
      "Lost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my lost\n",
      "ones!—\n",
      "With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in\n",
      "anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the\n",
      "spirit inspireth. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon\n",
      "him: for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy\n",
      "dawn.\n",
      "What hath happened unto me, mine animals?—said Zarathustra. Am I not\n",
      "transformed? Hath not bliss come unto me like a whirlwind?\n",
      "Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is\n",
      "still too young—so have patience with it!\n",
      "Wounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians unto\n",
      "me!\n",
      "To my friends can I again go down, and also to mine enemies!\n",
      "Zarathustra can again speak and bestow, and show his best love to his\n",
      "loved ones!\n",
      "My impatient love overfloweth in streams,—down towards sunrise and\n",
      "sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rusheth my\n",
      "soul into the valleys.\n",
      "Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long hath\n",
      "solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.\n",
      "Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from\n",
      "high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.\n",
      "And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How\n",
      "should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!\n",
      "Forsooth, there is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but\n",
      "the stream of my love beareth this along with it, down—to the sea!\n",
      "New paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired have I\n",
      "become— like all creators—of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit\n",
      "walk on worn-out soles.\n",
      "Too slowly runneth all speaking for me:—into thy chariot, O storm, do\n",
      "I leap! And even thee will I whip with my spite!\n",
      "Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the\n",
      "Happy Isles where my friends sojourn;—\n",
      "And mine enemies amongst them! How I now love every one unto whom I\n",
      "may but speak! Even mine enemies pertain to my bliss.\n",
      "And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my spear always\n",
      "help me up best: it is my foot’s ever ready servant:—\n",
      "The spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I to mine\n",
      "enemies that I may at last hurl it!\n",
      "Too great hath been the tension of my cloud: ‘twixt laughters of\n",
      "lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.\n",
      "Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm\n",
      "over the mountains: thus cometh its assuagement.\n",
      "Verily, like a storm cometh my happiness, and my freedom! But mine\n",
      "enemies shall think that THE EVIL ONE roareth over their heads.\n",
      "Yea, ye also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and\n",
      "perhaps ye will flee therefrom, along with mine enemies.\n",
      "Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds’ flutes! Ah, that\n",
      "my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we already\n",

      "The figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling\n",
      "the red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.\n",
      "Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe\n",

      "beyond your creating will.\n",
      "Could ye CREATE a God?—Then, I pray you, be silent about all Gods!\n",
      "But ye could well create the Superman.\n",
      "Not perhaps ye yourselves, my brethren! But into fathers and\n",
      "forefathers of the Superman could ye transform yourselves: and let that\n",
      "be your best creating!—\n",

      "to the conceivable.\n",
      "Could ye CONCEIVE a God?—But let this mean Will to Truth unto you,\n",
      "that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the humanly\n",
      "visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall ye follow out\n",
      "to the end!\n",
      "And what ye have called the world shall but be created by you: your\n",

      "verily, for your bliss, ye discerning ones!\n",
      "And how would ye endure life without that hope, ye discerning ones?\n",
      "Neither in the inconceivable could ye have been born, nor in the\n",

      "no Gods.\n",
      "Yea, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, doth it draw me.—\n",
      "God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this\n",
      "conjecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creating\n",
      "one, and from the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?\n",
      "God is a thought—it maketh all the straight crooked, and all that\n",
      "standeth reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be\n",
      "but a lie?\n",
      "To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even\n",
      "vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to\n",
      "conjecture such a thing.\n",
      "Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one,\n",

      "imperishable!\n",
      "All the imperishable—that’s but a simile, and the poets lie too\n",
      "much.—\n",

      "shall they be, and a justification of all perishableness!\n",
      "Creating—that is the great salvation from suffering, and life’s\n",
      "alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed,\n",
      "and much transformation.\n",
      "Yea, much bitter dying must there be in your life, ye creators! Thus\n",
      "are ye advocates and justifiers of all perishableness.\n",
      "For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be\n",

      "emancipation—so teacheth you Zarathustra.\n",
      "No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,\n",
      "that that great debility may ever be far from me!\n",
      "And also in discerning do I feel only my will’s procreating and\n",
      "evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is\n",

      "Away from God and Gods did this will allure me; what would there be\n",
      "to create if there were—Gods!\n",

      "stone!\n",
      "Now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone\n",
      "fly the fragments: what’s that to me?\n",
      "I will complete it: for a shadow came unto me—the stillest and\n",
      "lightest of all things once came unto me!\n",
      "The beauty of the Superman came unto me as a shadow. Ah, my brethren!\n",
      "Of what account now are—the Gods to me!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXV. THE PITIFUL.\n",
      "My friends, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: “Behold\n",
      "Zarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals?”\n",
      "But it is better said in this wise: “The discerning one walketh\n",
      "amongst men AS amongst animals.”\n",
      "Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.\n",
      "How hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath had to be\n",
      "ashamed too oft?\n",
      "O my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, shame,\n",
      "shame—that is the history of man!\n",
      "And on that account doth the noble one enjoin upon himself not to\n",
      "abash: bashfulness doth he enjoin on himself in presence of all\n",
      "sufferers.\n",
      "Verily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their\n",
      "pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness.\n",
      "If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it\n",
      "is preferably at a distance.\n",
      "Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being\n",
      "recognised: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!\n",
      "May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path,\n",
      "and those with whom I MAY have hope and repast and honey in common!\n",
      "Verily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something\n",
      "better did I always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself\n",
      "better.\n",
      "Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself too little:\n",
      "that alone, my brethren, is our original sin!\n",
      "And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best\n",
      "to give pain unto others, and to contrive pain.\n",
      "Therefore do I wash the hand that hath helped the sufferer; therefore\n",
      "do I wipe also my soul.\n",
      "For in seeing the sufferer suffering—thereof was I ashamed on account\n",
      "of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.\n",
      "Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a\n",
      "small kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing worm.\n",
      "“Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!”—thus do I advise\n",
      "those who have naught to bestow.\n",
      "I, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend to\n",
      "friends. Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the\n",
      "fruit from my tree: thus doth it cause less shame.\n",
      "Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, it\n",
      "annoyeth one to give unto them, and it annoyeth one not to give unto\n",
      "them.\n",
      "And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the\n",
      "sting of conscience teacheth one to sting.\n",
      "The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, better to\n",
      "have done evilly than to have thought pettily!\n",
      "To be sure, ye say: “The delight in petty evils spareth one many a\n",
      "great evil deed.” But here one should not wish to be sparing.\n",
      "Like a boil is the evil deed: it itcheth and irritateth and breaketh\n",
      "forth—it speaketh honourably.\n",
      "“Behold, I am disease,” saith the evil deed: that is its\n",
      "honourableness.\n",
      "But like infection is the petty thought: it creepeth and hideth, and\n",
      "wanteth to be nowhere—until the whole body is decayed and withered by\n",
      "the petty infection.\n",
      "To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this\n",
      "word in the ear: “Better for thee to rear up thy devil! Even for thee\n",
      "there is still a path to greatness!”—\n",
      "Ah, my brethren! One knoweth a little too much about every one! And\n",
      "many a one becometh transparent to us, but still we can by no means\n",
      "penetrate him.\n",
      "It is difficult to live among men because silence is so\n",
      "difficult.\n",
      "And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him\n",
      "who doth not concern us at all.\n",
      "If, however, thou hast a suffering friend, then be a resting-place\n",
      "for his suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus wilt thou\n",
      "serve him best.\n",
      "And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: “I forgive thee what thou\n",
      "hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto THYSELF, however—how\n",
      "could I forgive that!”\n",
      "Thus speaketh all great love: it surpasseth even forgiveness and\n",
      "pity.\n",
      "One should hold fast one’s heart; for when one letteth it go, how\n",
      "quickly doth one’s head run away!\n",
      "Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the\n",
      "pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the\n",
      "follies of the pitiful?\n",
      "Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above\n",
      "their pity!\n",
      "Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: “Even God hath his\n",
      "hell: it is his love for man.”\n",
      "And lately, did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity\n",
      "for man hath God died.”—\n",
      "So be ye warned against pity: FROM THENCE there yet cometh unto men a\n",
      "heavy cloud! Verily, I understand weather-signs!\n",
      "But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity:\n",
      "for it seeketh—to create what is loved!\n",
      "“Myself do I offer unto my love, AND MY NEIGHBOUR AS MYSELF”—such is\n",
      "the language of all creators.\n",
      "All creators, however, are hard.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXVI. THE PRIESTS.\n",
      "And one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples, and spake these\n",
      "words unto them:\n",
      "“Here are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass them\n",
      "quietly and with sleeping swords!\n",
      "Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too\n",
      "much—: so they want to make others suffer.\n",
      "Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.\n",
      "And readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them.\n",
      "But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood\n",
      "honoured in theirs.”—\n",
      "And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long\n",
      "had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:\n",
      "It moveth my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste;\n",
      "but that is the smallest matter unto me, since I am among men.\n",
      "But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they unto me,\n",
      "and stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in\n",
      "fetters:—\n",
      "In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would\n",
      "save them from their Saviour!\n",
      "On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed\n",
      "them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!\n",
      "False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for\n",
      "mortals—long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is in them.\n",
      "But at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and engulfeth\n",
      "whatever hath built tabernacles upon it.\n",
      "Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built\n",
      "themselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!\n",
      "Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul—may not\n",
      "fly aloft to its height!\n",
      "But so enjoineth their belief: “On your knees, up the stair, ye\n",
      "sinners!”\n",
      "Verily, rather would I see a shameless one than the distorted eyes of\n",
      "their shame and devotion!\n",
      "Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it\n",
      "not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under the\n",
      "clear sky?\n",
      "And only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs, and\n",
      "down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls—will I again turn my\n",
      "heart to the seats of this God.\n",
      "They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily,\n",
      "there was much hero-spirit in their worship!\n",
      "And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing men\n",
      "to the cross!\n",
      "As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;\n",
      "even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of\n",
      "charnel-houses.\n",
      "And he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools,\n",
      "wherein the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity.\n",
      "Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their\n",

      "me!\n",
      "Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach\n",
      "penitence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!\n",
      "Verily, their Saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom’s\n",
      "seventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never trod the carpets of\n",
      "knowledge!\n",
      "Of defects did the spirit of those Saviours consist; but into every\n",
      "defect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called\n",
      "God.\n",
      "In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and\n",
      "o’erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great\n",
      "folly.\n",
      "Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their\n",
      "foot-bridge; as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! Verily,\n",
      "those shepherds also were still of the flock!\n",
      "Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my\n",
      "brethren, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto\n",
      "been!\n",
      "Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their\n",
      "folly taught that truth is proved by blood.\n",
      "But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood tainteth the\n",
      "purest teaching, and turneth it into delusion and hatred of heart.\n",
      "And when a person goeth through fire for his teaching—what doth that\n",
      "prove! It is more, verily, when out of one’s own burning cometh one’s\n",
      "own teaching!\n",
      "Sultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there ariseth the\n",
      "blusterer, the “Saviour.”\n",
      "Greater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, than\n",
      "those whom the people call Saviours, those rapturous blusterers!\n",
      "And by still greater ones than any of the Saviours must ye be saved,\n",

      "greatest found I—all-too-human!—\n",

      "XXVII. THE VIRTUOUS.\n",
      "With thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and\n",
      "somnolent senses.\n",
      "But beauty’s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the most\n",
      "awakened souls.\n",
      "Gently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it was\n",
      "beauty’s holy laughing and thrilling.\n",
      "At you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its\n",
      "voice unto me: “They want—to be paid besides!”\n",
      "Ye want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want reward for\n",
      "virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?\n",
      "And now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver, nor\n",
      "paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own\n",
      "reward.\n",
      "Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and\n",
      "punishment been insinuated—and now even into the basis of your souls, ye\n",
      "virtuous ones!\n",
      "But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of\n",
      "your souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.\n",
      "All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when ye\n",
      "lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be\n",
      "separated from your truth.\n",
      "For this is your truth: ye are TOO PURE for the filth of the words:\n",
      "vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.\n",
      "Ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when did one\n",
      "hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love?\n",
      "It is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring’s thirst is in you: to\n",
      "reach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth itself.\n",
      "And like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your virtue:\n",
      "ever is its light on its way and travelling—and when will it cease to be\n",
      "on its way?\n",
      "Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when its work\n",
      "is done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light liveth and\n",
      "travelleth.\n",
      "That your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a skin, or a\n",
      "cloak: that is the truth from the basis of your souls, ye virtuous\n",
      "ones!—\n",
      "But sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under\n",
      "the lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying!\n",
      "And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices;\n",
      "and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs, their “justice”\n",
      "becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes.\n",
      "And others are there who are drawn downwards: their devils draw them.\n",
      "But the more they sink, the more ardently gloweth their eye, and the\n",
      "longing for their God.\n",
      "Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: “What\n",
      "I am NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!”\n",
      "And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, like carts\n",
      "taking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity and virtue—their drag\n",
      "they call virtue!\n",
      "And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up;\n",
      "they tick, and want people to call ticking—virtue.\n",
      "Verily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find such clocks I\n",
      "shall wind them up with my mockery, and they shall even whirr\n",
      "thereby!\n",
      "And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, and for the\n",
      "sake of it do violence to all things: so that the world is drowned in\n",
      "their unrighteousness.\n",
      "Ah! how ineptly cometh the word “virtue” out of their mouth! And when\n",
      "they say: “I am just,” it always soundeth like: “I am\n",
      "just—revenged!”\n",
      "With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their\n",

      "We bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would bite; and in\n",
      "all matters we have the opinion that is given us.”\n",
      "And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue\n",
      "is a sort of attitude.\n",
      "Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of\n",
      "virtue, but their heart knoweth naught thereof.\n",
      "And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: “Virtue is\n",
      "necessary”; but after all they believe only that policemen are\n",
      "necessary.\n",
      "And many a one who cannot see men’s loftiness, calleth it virtue to\n",
      "see their baseness far too well: thus calleth he his evil eye\n",
      "virtue.—\n",
      "And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and\n",
      "others want to be cast down,—and likewise call it virtue.\n",
      "And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at\n",

      "But Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools: “What\n",

      "That ye might become weary of the words “reward,” “retribution,”\n",
      "“punishment,” “righteous vengeance.”—\n",
      "That ye might become weary of saying: “That an action is good is\n",
      "because it is unselfish.”\n",
      "Ah! my friends! That YOUR very Self be in your action, as the mother\n",
      "is in the child: let that be YOUR formula of virtue!\n",
      "Verily, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue’s\n",
      "favourite playthings; and now ye upbraid me, as children upbraid.\n",
      "They played by the sea—then came there a wave and swept their\n",
      "playthings into the deep: and now do they cry.\n",
      "But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and spread before\n",
      "them new speckled shells!\n",
      "Thus will they be comforted; and like them shall ye also, my friends,\n",
      "have your comforting—and new speckled shells!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXVIII. THE RABBLE.\n",
      "Life is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all\n",
      "fountains are poisoned.\n",
      "To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the\n",
      "grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean.\n",
      "They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glanceth up to me\n",
      "their odious smile out of the fountain.\n",
      "The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when\n",
      "they called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the\n",
      "words.\n",
      "Indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the\n",
      "fire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach\n",
      "the fire.\n",
      "Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their hands: unsteady,\n",
      "and withered at the top, doth their look make the fruit-tree.\n",
      "And many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only turned away\n",
      "from the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and\n",
      "fruit.\n",
      "And many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst\n",
      "with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy\n",
      "camel-drivers.\n",
      "And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm\n",
      "to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the\n",
      "rabble, and thus stop their throat.\n",
      "And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that\n",
      "life itself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:—\n",
      "But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is\n",
      "the rabble also NECESSARY for life?\n",
      "Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy\n",
      "dreams, and maggots in the bread of life?\n",
      "Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah,\n",
      "ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble\n",
      "spiritual!\n",
      "And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call\n",
      "ruling: to traffic and bargain for power—with the rabble!\n",
      "Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears:\n",
      "so that the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me,\n",
      "and their bargaining for power.\n",
      "And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and\n",
      "to-days: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the\n",
      "scribbling rabble!\n",
      "Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb—thus have I lived\n",
      "long; that I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble,\n",
      "and the pleasure-rabble.\n",
      "Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of\n",
      "delight were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the\n",
      "blind one.\n",
      "What hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself from loathing?\n",
      "Who hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I flown to the height where no\n",
      "rabble any longer sit at the wells?\n",
      "Did my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining\n",
      "powers? Verily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the\n",
      "well of delight!\n",
      "Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height\n",
      "bubbleth up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose\n",
      "waters none of the rabble drink with me!\n",
      "Almost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain of delight!\n",
      "And often emptiest thou the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!\n",
      "And yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far too\n",
      "violently doth my heart still flow towards thee:—\n",
      "My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy,\n",
      "over-happy summer: how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness!\n",
      "Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my\n",
      "snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and\n",
      "summer-noontide!\n",
      "A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful\n",
      "stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more\n",
      "blissful!\n",
      "For this is OUR height and our home: too high and steep do we here\n",
      "dwell for all uncleanly ones and their thirst.\n",
      "Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How\n",
      "could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with ITS\n",
      "purity.\n",
      "On the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us\n",
      "lone ones food in their beaks!\n",
      "Verily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire,\n",
      "would they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!\n",
      "Verily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave\n",
      "to their bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!\n",
      "And as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the\n",
      "eagles, neighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun: thus live the\n",
      "strong winds.\n",
      "And like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit,\n",
      "take the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my future.\n",
      "Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this\n",
      "counsel counselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever spitteth and\n",
      "speweth: “Take care not to spit AGAINST the wind!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXIX. THE TARANTULAS.\n",
      "Lo, this is the tarantula’s den! Wouldst thou see the tarantula\n",
      "itself? Here hangeth its web: touch this, so that it may tremble.\n",
      "There cometh the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! Black on\n",
      "thy back is thy triangle and symbol; and I know also what is in thy\n",
      "soul.\n",
      "Revenge is in thy soul: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth black\n",
      "scab; with revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy!\n",
      "Thus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy, ye\n",
      "preachers of EQUALITY! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and secretly\n",
      "revengeful ones!\n",
      "But I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: therefore do I\n",
      "laugh in your face my laughter of the height.\n",
      "Therefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you out of\n",
      "your den of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your\n",
      "word “justice.”\n",
      "Because, FOR MAN TO BE REDEEMED FROM REVENGE—that is for me the\n",
      "bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms.\n",
      "Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. “Let it be very\n",
      "justice for the world to become full of the storms of our\n",
      "vengeance”—thus do they talk to one another.\n",
      "“Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like\n",
      "us”—thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.\n",
      "“And ‘Will to Equality’—that itself shall henceforth be the name of\n",
      "virtue; and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry!”\n",
      "Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus\n",
      "in you for “equality”: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise\n",
      "themselves thus in virtue-words!\n",
      "Fretted conceit and suppressed envy—perhaps your fathers’ conceit and\n",
      "envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.\n",
      "What the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft have I found\n",
      "in the son the father’s revealed secret.\n",
      "Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspireth\n",
      "them—but vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not\n",
      "spirit, but envy, that maketh them so.\n",
      "Their jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers’ paths; and this is\n",
      "the sign of their jealousy—they always go too far: so that their fatigue\n",
      "hath at last to go to sleep on the snow.\n",
      "In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their eulogies\n",
      "is maleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss.\n",
      "But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the\n",
      "impulse to punish is powerful!\n",
      "They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances\n",
      "peer the hangman and the sleuth-hound.\n",
      "Distrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in their\n",
      "souls not only honey is lacking.\n",
      "And when they call themselves “the good and just,” forget not, that\n",
      "for them to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but—power!\n",
      "My friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with others.\n",
      "There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at the same\n",
      "time preachers of equality, and tarantulas.\n",
      "That they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their den,\n",
      "these poison-spiders, and withdrawn from life—is because they would\n",
      "thereby do injury.\n",
      "To those would they thereby do injury who have power at present: for\n",
      "with those the preaching of death is still most at home.\n",
      "Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach otherwise: and\n",
      "they themselves were formerly the best world-maligners and\n",
      "heretic-burners.\n",
      "With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and\n",
      "confounded. For thus speaketh justice UNTO ME: “Men are not equal.”\n",
      "And neither shall they become so! What would be my love to the\n",
      "Superman, if I spake otherwise?\n",
      "On a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future, and\n",

      "Inventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities;\n",
      "and with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other\n",
      "the supreme fight!\n",
      "Good and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and all names of\n",
      "values: weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, that life must again\n",
      "and again surpass itself!\n",
      "Aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs—life itself: into\n",
      "remote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful beauties—\n",
      "THEREFORE doth it require elevation!\n",
      "And because it requireth elevation, therefore doth it require steps,\n",
      "and variance of steps and climbers! To rise striveth life, and in rising\n",
      "to surpass itself.\n",
      "And just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula’s den is,\n",
      "riseth aloft an ancient temple’s ruins—just behold it with enlightened\n",
      "eyes!\n",
      "Verily, he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, knew as well\n",

      "XXX. THE FAMOUS WISE ONES.\n",
      "The people have ye served and the people’s superstition—NOT the\n",

      "you reverence.\n",

      "XXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.\n",
      "One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest;\n",
      "and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow\n",
      "peacefully surrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing\n",
      "together. As soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they ceased\n",
      "dancing; Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and\n",
      "spake these words:\n",
      "Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler hath come\n",
      "to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.\n",
      "God’s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of\n",
      "gravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances?\n",
      "Or to maidens’ feet with fine ankles?\n",
      "To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is\n",
      "not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my\n",
      "cypresses.\n",
      "And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens:\n",
      "beside the well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes.\n",
      "Verily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he\n",
      "perhaps chased butterflies too much?\n",
      "Upbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God\n",
      "somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep—but he is laughable even when\n",
      "weeping!\n",
      "And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself\n",
      "will sing a song to his dance:\n",
      "A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest,\n",
      "powerfulest devil, who is said to be “lord of the world.”—\n",
      "And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens\n",
      "danced together:\n",
      "Of late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable\n",
      "did I there seem to sink.\n",
      "But thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively didst thou\n",
      "laugh when I called thee unfathomable.\n",
      "“Such is the language of all fish,” saidst thou; “what THEY do not\n",
      "fathom is unfathomable.\n",
      "But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no\n",
      "virtuous one:\n",
      "Though I be called by you men the ‘profound one,’ or the ‘faithful\n",
      "one,’ ‘the eternal one,’ ‘the mysterious one.’\n",
      "But ye men endow us always with your own virtues—alas, ye virtuous\n",
      "ones!”\n",
      "Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her\n",
      "and her laughter, when she speaketh evil of herself.\n",
      "And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me\n",
      "angrily: “Thou willest, thou cravest, thou lovest; on that account alone\n",
      "dost thou PRAISE Life!”\n",
      "Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the\n",
      "angry one; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one “telleth\n",
      "the truth” to one’s Wisdom.\n",
      "For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only\n",
      "Life—and verily, most when I hate her!\n",
      "But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she\n",
      "remindeth me very strongly of Life!\n",
      "She hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I\n",
      "responsible for it that both are so alike?\n",
      "And when once Life asked me: “Who is she then, this Wisdom?”—then\n",
      "said I eagerly: “Ah, yes! Wisdom!\n",
      "One thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh through\n",
      "veils, one graspeth through nets.\n",
      "Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still\n",
      "lured by her.\n",
      "Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip,\n",
      "and pass the comb against the grain of her hair.\n",
      "Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she\n",
      "speaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce most.”\n",
      "When I had said this unto Life, then laughed she maliciously, and\n",
      "shut her eyes. “Of whom dost thou speak?” said she. “Perhaps of me?\n",
      "And if thou wert right—is it proper to say THAT in such wise to my\n",
      "face! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!”\n",
      "Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved Life! And\n",
      "into the unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.—\n",
      "Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens\n",
      "had departed, he became sad.\n",
      "“The sun hath been long set,” said he at last, “the meadow is damp,\n",
      "and from the forest cometh coolness.\n",
      "An unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. What! Thou\n",
      "livest still, Zarathustra?\n",
      "Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly still\n",
      "to live?—\n",
      "Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me.\n",
      "Forgive me my sadness!\n",
      "Evening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come on!”\n",
      "Thus sang Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXXIII. THE GRAVE-SONG.\n",

      "Oh, ye sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all ye gleams of love, ye\n",
      "divine fleeting gleams! How could ye perish so soon for me! I think of\n",
      "you to-day as my dead ones.\n",
      "From you, my dearest dead ones, cometh unto me a sweet savour,\n",
      "heart-opening and melting. Verily, it convulseth and openeth the heart\n",
      "of the lone seafarer.\n",
      "Still am I the richest and most to be envied—I, the lonesomest one!\n",
      "For I HAVE POSSESSED you, and ye possess me still. Tell me: to whom hath\n",

      "Ah, we were made to remain nigh unto each other, ye kindly strange\n",

      "Yea, made for faithfulness, like me, and for fond eternities, must I\n",
      "now name you by your faithlessness, ye divine glances and fleeting\n",

      "Verily, too early did ye die for me, ye fugitives. Yet did ye not\n",
      "flee from me, nor did I flee from you: innocent are we to each other in\n",
      "our faithlessness.\n",
      "To kill ME, did they strangle you, ye singing birds of my hopes! Yea,\n",
      "at you, ye dearest ones, did malice ever shoot its arrows—to hit my\n",
      "heart!\n",
      "And they hit it! Because ye were always my dearest, my possession and\n",
      "my possessedness: ON THAT ACCOUNT had ye to die young, and far too\n",
      "early!\n",
      "At my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow—namely, at you,\n",
      "whose skin is like down—or more like the smile that dieth at a\n",

      "But this word will I say unto mine enemies: What is all manslaughter\n",
      "in comparison with what ye have done unto me!\n",
      "Worse evil did ye do unto me than all manslaughter; the irretrievable\n",
      "did ye take from me:—thus do I speak unto you, mine enemies!\n",
      "Slew ye not my youth’s visions and dearest marvels! My playmates took\n",

      "Thus spake once in a happy hour my purity: “Divine shall everything\n",

      "But then did ye enemies steal my nights, and sold them to sleepless\n",
      "torture: ah, whither hath that joyous wisdom now fled?\n",
      "Once did I long for happy auspices: then did ye lead an owl-monster\n",
      "across my path, an adverse sign. Ah, whither did my tender longing then\n",
      "flee?\n",
      "All loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did ye change my nigh\n",

      "wounded the faith of my virtue.\n",
      "And when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately did your\n",
      "“piety” put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest suffocated in\n",
      "the fumes of your fat.\n",
      "And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced: beyond all\n",
      "heavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my favourite\n",

      "shut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its eye spake unto\n",
      "me.\n",
      "But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language\n",
      "of obedience. All living things are obeying things.\n",
      "And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded.\n",
      "Such is the nature of living things.\n",
      "This, however, is the third thing which I heard—namely, that\n",
      "commanding is more difficult than obeying. And not only because the\n",
      "commander beareth the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden\n",
      "readily crusheth him:—\n",
      "An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and whenever it\n",
      "commandeth, the living thing risketh itself thereby.\n",
      "Yea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it atone for its\n",
      "commanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and\n",
      "victim.\n",
      "How doth this happen! so did I ask myself. What persuadeth the living\n",
      "thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?\n",
      "Hearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether\n",
      "I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its\n",
      "heart!\n",
      "Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and\n",
      "even in the will of the servant found I the will to be master.\n",
      "That to the stronger the weaker shall serve—thereto persuadeth he his\n",
      "will who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he\n",

      "And this secret spake Life herself unto me. “Behold,” said she, “I am\n",

      "doth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.\n",
      "With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power, ye\n",
      "valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,\n",
      "trembling, and overflowing of your souls.\n",
      "But a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new\n",

      "Thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: that,\n",
      "however, is the creating good.—\n",
      "Let us SPEAK thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. To be\n",

      "redeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly children should he\n",
      "transform them.\n",
      "As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without\n",
      "jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty.\n",
      "Verily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, but in\n",
      "beauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the\n",
      "magnanimous.\n",
      "His arm across his head: thus should the hero repose; thus should he\n",

      "But precisely to the hero is BEAUTY the hardest thing of all.\n",
      "Unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills.\n",
      "A little more, a little less: precisely this is much here, it is the\n",
      "most here.\n",
      "To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: that is the\n",
      "hardest for all of you, ye sublime ones!\n",
      "When power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible—I call\n",
      "such condescension, beauty.\n",
      "And from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee, thou powerful\n",
      "one: let thy goodness be thy last self-conquest.\n",
      "All evil do I accredit to thee: therefore do I desire of thee the\n",
      "good.\n",
      "Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves\n",
      "good because they have crippled paws!\n",
      "The virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after: more beautiful doth\n",
      "it ever become, and more graceful—but internally harder and more\n",
      "sustaining—the higher it riseth.\n",
      "Yea, thou sublime one, one day shalt thou also be beautiful, and hold\n",
      "up the mirror to thine own beauty.\n",
      "Then will thy soul thrill with divine desires; and there will be\n",
      "adoration even in thy vanity!\n",
      "For this is the secret of the soul: when the hero hath abandoned it,\n",
      "then only approacheth it in dreams—the superhero.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXXVI. THE LAND OF CULTURE.\n",
      "Too far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.\n",
      "And when I looked around me, lo! there time was my sole\n",
      "contemporary.\n",
      "Then did I fly backwards, homewards—and always faster. Thus did I\n",
      "come unto you, ye present-day men, and into the land of culture.\n",
      "For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire:\n",
      "verily, with longing in my heart did I come.\n",
      "But how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed—I had yet to\n",
      "laugh! Never did mine eye see anything so motley-coloured!\n",
      "I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as\n",
      "well. “Here forsooth, is the home of all the paintpots,”—said I.\n",
      "With fifty patches painted on faces and limbs—so sat ye there to mine\n",
      "astonishment, ye present-day men!\n",
      "And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of\n",
      "colours, and repeated it!\n",
      "Verily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, than your\n",
      "own faces! Who could—RECOGNISE you!\n",
      "Written all over with the characters of the past, and these\n",
      "characters also pencilled over with new characters—thus have ye\n",
      "concealed yourselves well from all decipherers!\n",
      "And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth that ye\n",
      "have reins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out of glued\n",
      "scraps.\n",
      "All times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; all\n",
      "customs and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your gestures.\n",
      "He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and\n",
      "gestures, would just have enough left to scare the crows.\n",
      "Verily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and\n",
      "without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.\n",
      "Rather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and among the\n",
      "shades of the bygone!—Fatter and fuller than ye, are forsooth the\n",
      "nether-worldlings!\n",
      "This, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure\n",
      "you naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!\n",
      "All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh strayed\n",
      "birds shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your\n",
      "“reality.”\n",
      "For thus speak ye: “Real are we wholly, and without faith and\n",
      "superstition”: thus do ye plume yourselves—alas! even without\n",
      "plumes!\n",
      "Indeed, how would ye be ABLE to believe, ye divers-coloured ones!—ye\n",
      "who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed!\n",
      "Perambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dislocation\n",
      "of all thought. UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES: thus do I call you, ye real\n",
      "ones!\n",
      "All periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams\n",
      "and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!\n",
      "Unfruitful are ye: THEREFORE do ye lack belief. But he who had to\n",
      "create, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions—and\n",
      "believed in believing!—\n",
      "Half-open doors are ye, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is YOUR\n",
      "reality: “Everything deserveth to perish.”\n",
      "Alas, how ye stand there before me, ye unfruitful ones; how lean your\n",
      "ribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.\n",
      "Many a one hath said: “There hath surely a God filched something from\n",
      "me secretly whilst I slept? Verily, enough to make a girl for himself\n",
      "therefrom!\n",
      "“Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!” thus hath spoken many a\n",
      "present-day man.\n",
      "Yea, ye are laughable unto me, ye present-day men! And especially\n",
      "when ye marvel at yourselves!\n",
      "And woe unto me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to\n",
      "swallow all that is repugnant in your platters!\n",
      "As it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry\n",
      "what is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also\n",
      "alight on my load!\n",
      "Verily, it shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not\n",
      "from you, ye present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.—\n",
      "Ah, whither shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do\n",
      "I look out for fatherlands and motherlands.\n",
      "But a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and\n",
      "decamping at all gates.\n",
      "Alien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late\n",
      "my heart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and\n",
      "motherlands.\n",
      "Thus do I love only my CHILDREN’S LAND, the undiscovered in the\n",

      "XXXVII. IMMACULATE PERCEPTION.\n",
      "When yester-eve the moon arose, then did I fancy it about to bear a\n",
      "sun: so broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon.\n",
      "But it was a liar with its pregnancy; and sooner will I believe in\n",
      "the man in the moon than in the woman.\n",
      "To be sure, little of a man is he also, that timid night-reveller.\n",
      "Verily, with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs.\n",
      "For he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; covetous of the\n",
      "earth, and all the joys of lovers.\n",
      "Nay, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful unto me are\n",
      "all that slink around half-closed windows!\n",
      "Piously and silently doth he stalk along on the star-carpets:—but I\n",
      "like no light-treading human feet, on which not even a spur\n",
      "jingleth.\n",
      "Every honest one’s step speaketh; the cat however, stealeth along\n",
      "over the ground. Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, and\n",
      "dishonestly.—\n",
      "This parable speak I unto you sentimental dissemblers, unto you, the\n",
      "“pure discerners!” You do I call—covetous ones!\n",
      "Also ye love the earth, and the earthly: I have divined you well!—but\n",
      "shame is in your love, and a bad conscience—ye are like the moon!\n",
      "To despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded, but not your\n",
      "bowels: these, however, are the strongest in you!\n",
      "And now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels,\n",
      "and goeth by-ways and lying ways to escape its own shame.\n",
      "“That would be the highest thing for me”—so saith your lying spirit\n",
      "unto itself—“to gaze upon life without desire, and not like the dog,\n",
      "with hanging-out tongue:\n",
      "To be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and greed\n",
      "of selfishness—cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated\n",
      "moon-eyes!\n",
      "That would be the dearest thing to me”—thus doth the seduced one\n",
      "seduce himself,—“to love the earth as the moon loveth it, and with the\n",
      "eye only to feel its beauty.\n",
      "And this do I call IMMACULATE perception of all things: to want\n",
      "nothing else from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror\n",
      "with a hundred facets.”—\n",
      "Oh, ye sentimental dissemblers, ye covetous ones! Ye lack innocence\n",
      "in your desire: and now do ye defame desiring on that account!\n",
      "Verily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye love\n",
      "the earth!\n",
      "Where is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who\n",
      "seeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the purest will.\n",
      "Where is beauty? Where I MUST WILL with my whole Will; where I will\n",
      "love and perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.\n",
      "Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love:\n",
      "that is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak unto you\n",
      "cowards!\n",
      "But now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be “contemplation!”\n",
      "And that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened\n",

      "the horizon!\n",
      "Verily, ye fill your mouth with noble words: and we are to believe\n",
      "that your heart overfloweth, ye cozeners?\n",
      "But MY words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: gladly do I\n",
      "pick up what falleth from the table at your repasts.\n",
      "Yet still can I say therewith the truth—to dissemblers! Yea, my\n",

      "God’s mask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled.\n",
      "Verily ye deceive, ye “contemplative ones!” Even Zarathustra was once\n",
      "the dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not divine the serpent’s coil\n",
      "with which it was stuffed.\n",
      "A God’s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, ye pure\n",
      "discerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your arts!\n",
      "Serpents’ filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from me: and\n",
      "that a lizard’s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously.\n",
      "But I came NIGH unto you: then came to me the day,—and now cometh it\n",
      "to you,—at an end is the moon’s love affair!\n",
      "See there! Surprised and pale doth it stand—before the rosy dawn!\n",
      "For already she cometh, the glowing one,—HER love to the earth\n",
      "cometh! Innocence and creative desire, is all solar love!\n",
      "See there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye not feel\n",
      "the thirst and the hot breath of her love?\n",
      "At the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: now\n",
      "riseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts.\n",
      "Kissed and sucked WOULD it be by the thirst of the sun; vapour WOULD\n",
      "it become, and height, and path of light, and light itself!\n",
      "Verily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas.\n",
      "And this meaneth TO ME knowledge: all that is deep shall ascend—to my\n",
      "height!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXXVIII. SCHOLARS.\n",
      "When I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my\n",
      "head,—it ate, and said thereby: “Zarathustra is no longer a\n",
      "scholar.”\n",
      "It said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall,\n",
      "among thistles and red poppies.\n",
      "A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and\n",
      "red poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.\n",
      "But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so willeth my\n",
      "lot—blessings upon it!\n",
      "For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the\n",
      "scholars, and the door have I also slammed behind me.\n",
      "Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I\n",
      "got the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.\n",
      "Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep\n",
      "on ox-skins than on their honours and dignities.\n",
      "I am too hot and scorched with mine own thought: often is it ready to\n",
      "take away my breath. Then have I to go into the open air, and away from\n",
      "all dusty rooms.\n",
      "But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything to be\n",
      "merely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: thus\n",
      "do they also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others have\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "Should one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like\n",
      "flour-sacks, and involuntarily: but who would divine that their dust\n",
      "came from corn, and from the yellow delight of the summer fields?\n",
      "When they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty sayings\n",
      "and truths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it\n",
      "came from the swamp; and verily, I have even heard the frog croak in\n",
      "it!\n",
      "Clever are they—they have dexterous fingers: what doth MY simplicity\n",
      "pretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading and knitting and\n",
      "weaving do their fingers understand: thus do they make the hose of the\n",
      "spirit!\n",
      "Good clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up properly!\n",
      "Then do they indicate the hour without mistake, and make a modest noise\n",
      "thereby.\n",
      "Like millstones do they work, and like pestles: throw only seed-corn\n",
      "unto them!—they know well how to grind corn small, and make white dust\n",
      "out of it.\n",
      "They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the\n",
      "best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge\n",
      "walketh on lame feet,—like spiders do they wait.\n",
      "I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always\n",
      "did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.\n",
      "They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find\n",
      "them playing, that they perspired thereby.\n",
      "We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant\n",
      "to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice.\n",
      "And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did\n",
      "they take a dislike to me.\n",
      "They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and\n",
      "so they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads.\n",
      "Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto\n",
      "been heard by the most learned.\n",
      "All mankind’s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves\n",
      "and me:—they call it “false ceiling” in their houses.\n",
      "But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts ABOVE their heads; and even\n",
      "should I walk on mine own errors, still would I be above them and their\n",
      "heads.\n",
      "For men are NOT equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, THEY may\n",
      "not will!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XXXIX. POETS.\n",
      "“Since I have known the body better”—said Zarathustra to one of his\n",
      "disciples—“the spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit; and all\n",
      "the ‘imperishable’—that is also but a simile.”\n",
      "“So have I heard thee say once before,” answered the disciple, “and\n",
      "then thou addedst: ‘But the poets lie too much.’ Why didst thou say that\n",
      "the poets lie too much?”\n",
      "“Why?” said Zarathustra. “Thou askest why? I do not belong to those\n",
      "who may be asked after their Why.\n",
      "Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced\n",
      "the reasons for mine opinions.\n",
      "Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my\n",
      "reasons with me?\n",
      "It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; and many\n",
      "a bird flieth away.\n",
      "And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote,\n",
      "which is alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my hand upon it.\n",
      "But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too\n",
      "much?—But Zarathustra also is a poet.\n",
      "Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "The disciple answered: “I believe in Zarathustra.” But Zarathustra\n",
      "shook his head and smiled.—\n",
      "Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in\n",
      "myself.\n",
      "But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets\n",
      "lie too much: he was right—WE do lie too much.\n",
      "We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to\n",
      "lie.\n",
      "And which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous\n",
      "hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing hath\n",
      "there been done.\n",
      "And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart\n",
      "with the poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!\n",
      "And even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one\n",
      "another in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in\n",
      "us.\n",
      "And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which\n",
      "CHOKETH UP for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people\n",
      "and in their “wisdom.”\n",
      "This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh up his\n",
      "ears when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth something of\n",
      "the things that are betwixt heaven and earth.\n",
      "And if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the poets always\n",
      "think that nature herself is in love with them:\n",
      "And that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, and\n",
      "amorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride themselves, before\n",
      "all mortals!\n",
      "Ah, there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only\n",
      "the poets have dreamed!\n",
      "And especially ABOVE the heavens: for all Gods are\n",
      "poet-symbolisations, poet-sophistications!\n",
      "Verily, ever are we drawn aloft—that is, to the realm of the clouds:\n",
      "on these do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call them Gods and\n",
      "Supermen:—\n",
      "Are not they light enough for those chairs!—all these Gods and\n",
      "Supermen?—\n",
      "Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as\n",
      "actual! Ah, how I am weary of the poets!\n",
      "When Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but was silent.\n",
      "And Zarathustra also was silent; and his eye directed itself inwardly,\n",
      "as if it gazed into the far distance. At last he sighed and drew\n",
      "breath.—\n",
      "I am of to-day and heretofore, said he thereupon; but something is in\n",
      "me that is of the morrow, and the day following, and the hereafter.\n",
      "I became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: superficial\n",
      "are they all unto me, and shallow seas.\n",
      "They did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their\n",
      "feeling did not reach to the bottom.\n",
      "Some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium: these\n",
      "have as yet been their best contemplation.\n",
      "Ghost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the\n",
      "jingle-jangling of their harps; what have they known hitherto of the\n",
      "fervour of tones!—\n",
      "They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their water\n",
      "that it may seem deep.\n",
      "And fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but\n",
      "mediaries and mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, and\n",
      "impure!—\n",
      "Ah, I cast indeed my net into their sea, and meant to catch good\n",
      "fish; but always did I draw up the head of some ancient God.\n",
      "Thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they themselves\n",
      "may well originate from the sea.\n",
      "Certainly, one findeth pearls in them: thereby they are the more like\n",
      "hard molluscs. And instead of a soul, I have often found in them salt\n",
      "slime.\n",
      "They have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the sea the\n",
      "peacock of peacocks?\n",
      "Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out its tail;\n",
      "never doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk.\n",
      "Disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the sand with\n",
      "its soul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, to the\n",
      "swamp.\n",
      "What is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This parable I\n",
      "speak unto the poets.\n",
      "Verily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a sea of\n",
      "vanity!\n",
      "Spectators, seeketh the spirit of the poet—should they even be\n",
      "buffaloes!—\n",
      "But of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming when it\n",
      "will become weary of itself.\n",
      "Yea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned towards\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "Penitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out of the\n",
      "poets.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XL. GREAT EVENTS.\n",
      "There is an isle in the sea—not far from the Happy Isles of\n",
      "Zarathustra—on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people,\n",
      "and especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a\n",
      "rock before the gate of the nether-world; but that through the volcano\n",
      "itself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this\n",
      "gate.\n",
      "Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it\n",
      "happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking\n",
      "mountain, and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide\n",
      "hour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they\n",
      "saw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said\n",
      "distinctly: “It is time! It is the highest time!” But when the figure\n",
      "was nearest to them (it flew past quickly, however, like a shadow, in\n",
      "the direction of the volcano), then did they recognise with the greatest\n",
      "surprise that it was Zarathustra; for they had all seen him before\n",
      "except the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: in\n",
      "such wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree.\n",
      "“Behold!” said the old helmsman, “there goeth Zarathustra to\n",
      "hell!”\n",
      "About the same time that these sailors landed on the fire-isle, there\n",
      "was a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were\n",
      "asked about it, they said that he had gone on board a ship by night,\n",
      "without saying whither he was going.\n",
      "Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, however, there\n",
      "came the story of the ship’s crew in addition to this uneasiness—and\n",
      "then did all the people say that the devil had taken Zarathustra. His\n",
      "disciples laughed, sure enough, at this talk; and one of them said even:\n",
      "“Sooner would I believe that Zarathustra hath taken the devil.” But at\n",
      "the bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so\n",
      "their joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst\n",
      "them.\n",
      "And this is the account of Zarathustra’s interview with the\n",
      "fire-dog:\n",
      "The earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. One of\n",
      "these diseases, for example, is called “man.”\n",
      "And another of these diseases is called “the fire-dog”: concerning\n",
      "HIM men have greatly deceived themselves, and let themselves be\n",
      "deceived.\n",
      "To fathom this mystery did I go o’er the sea; and I have seen the\n",
      "truth naked, verily! barefooted up to the neck.\n",
      "Now do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and likewise\n",
      "concerning all the spouting and subversive devils, of which not only old\n",
      "women are afraid.\n",
      "“Up with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!” cried I, “and confess how\n",
      "deep that depth is! Whence cometh that which thou snortest up?\n",
      "Thou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embittered\n",
      "eloquence betray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou takest thy\n",
      "nourishment too much from the surface!\n",
      "At the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: and\n",
      "ever, when I have heard subversive and spouting devils speak, I have\n",
      "found them like thee: embittered, mendacious, and shallow.\n",
      "Ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are the best\n",
      "braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs\n",
      "boil.\n",
      "Where ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is\n",
      "spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have freedom.\n",
      "‘Freedom’ ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief\n",
      "in ‘great events,’ when there is much roaring and smoke about them.\n",
      "And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events—are not our\n",
      "noisiest, but our stillest hours.\n",
      "Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of\n",
      "new values, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.\n",
      "And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy noise and\n",
      "smoke passed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay\n",
      "in the mud!\n",
      "And this do I say also to the o’erthrowers of statues: It is\n",
      "certainly the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues\n",
      "into the mud.\n",
      "In the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its law,\n",
      "that out of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again!\n",
      "With diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its suffering;\n",
      "and verily! it will yet thank you for o’erthrowing it, ye\n",
      "subverters!\n",
      "This counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, and to all\n",
      "that is weak with age or virtue—let yourselves be o’erthrown! That ye\n",
      "may again come to life, and that virtue—may come to you!—”\n",
      "Thus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me sullenly,\n",
      "and asked: “Church? What is that?”\n",
      "“Church?” answered I, “that is a kind of state, and indeed the most\n",
      "mendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! Thou surely knowest\n",
      "thine own species best!\n",
      "Like thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like thee doth it like\n",
      "to speak with smoke and roaring—to make believe, like thee, that it\n",
      "speaketh out of the heart of things.\n",
      "For it seeketh by all means to be the most important creature on\n",
      "earth, the state; and people think it so.”\n",
      "When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. “What!”\n",
      "cried he, “the most important creature on earth? And people think it\n",
      "so?” And so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat, that\n",
      "I thought he would choke with vexation and envy.\n",
      "At last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, however,\n",
      "as he was quiet, I said laughingly:\n",
      "“Thou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee!\n",
      "And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of another\n",
      "fire-dog; he speaketh actually out of the heart of the earth.\n",
      "Gold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his heart\n",
      "desire. What are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him!\n",
      "Laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is he to\n",
      "thy gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels!\n",
      "The gold, however, and the laughter—these doth he take out of the\n",
      "heart of the earth: for, that thou mayst know it,—THE HEART OF THE EARTH\n",
      "IS OF GOLD.”\n",
      "When the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to listen to\n",
      "me. Abashed did he draw in his tail, said “bow-wow!” in a cowed voice,\n",
      "and crept down into his cave.—\n",
      "Thus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly listened to\n",
      "him: so great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors, the\n",
      "rabbits, and the flying man.\n",
      "“What am I to think of it!” said Zarathustra. “Am I indeed a\n",
      "ghost?\n",
      "But it may have been my shadow. Ye have surely heard something of the\n",
      "Wanderer and his Shadow?\n",
      "One thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold of it;\n",
      "otherwise it will spoil my reputation.”\n",
      "And once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. “What am I to\n",
      "think of it!” said he once more.\n",
      "“Why did the ghost cry: ‘It is time! It is the highest time!’\n",
      "For what is it then—the highest time?”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XLI. THE SOOTHSAYER.\n",
      "“—And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary\n",
      "of their works.\n",
      "A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: ‘All is empty, all is\n",
      "alike, all hath been!’\n",
      "And from all hills there re-echoed: ‘All is empty, all is alike, all\n",
      "hath been!’\n",
      "To be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become\n",
      "rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?\n",
      "In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the evil eye\n",
      "hath singed yellow our fields and hearts.\n",
      "Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn\n",
      "dust like ashes:—yea, the fire itself have we made aweary.\n",
      "All our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. All the\n",
      "ground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow!\n",
      "‘Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?’ so\n",
      "soundeth our plaint—across shallow swamps.\n",
      "Verily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake\n",
      "and live on—in sepulchres.”\n",
      "Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding\n",
      "touched his heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully did he go about and\n",
      "wearily; and he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had\n",
      "spoken.—\n",
      "Verily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there cometh\n",
      "the long twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it!\n",
      "That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter worlds\n",
      "shall it be a light, and also to remotest nights!\n",
      "Thus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for three\n",
      "days he did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, and lost his\n",
      "speech. At last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. His\n",
      "disciples, however, sat around him in long night-watches, and waited\n",
      "anxiously to see if he would awake, and speak again, and recover from\n",
      "his affliction.\n",
      "And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he awoke; his\n",
      "voice, however, came unto his disciples as from afar:\n",
      "Hear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me\n",
      "to divine its meaning!\n",
      "A riddle is it still unto me, this dream; the meaning is hidden in it\n",
      "and encaged, and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions.\n",
      "All life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman and\n",
      "grave-guardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain-fortress of\n",
      "Death.\n",
      "There did I guard his coffins: full stood the musty vaults of those\n",
      "trophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon\n",
      "me.\n",
      "The odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry and\n",
      "dust-covered lay my soul. And who could have aired his soul there!\n",
      "Brightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness cowered\n",
      "beside her; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the worst of my\n",
      "female friends.\n",
      "Keys did I carry, the rustiest of all keys; and I knew how to open\n",
      "with them the most creaking of all gates.\n",
      "Like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long\n",
      "corridors when the leaves of the gate opened: ungraciously did this bird\n",
      "cry, unwillingly was it awakened.\n",
      "But more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, when it\n",
      "again became silent and still all around, and I alone sat in that\n",
      "malignant silence.\n",
      "Thus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still was:\n",
      "what do I know thereof! But at last there happened that which awoke\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice did the\n",
      "vaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the gate.\n",
      "Alpa! cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? Alpa! Alpa!\n",
      "who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain?\n",
      "And I pressed the key, and pulled at the gate, and exerted myself.\n",
      "But not a finger’s-breadth was it yet open:\n",
      "Then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, whizzing,\n",
      "and piercing, it threw unto me a black coffin.\n",
      "And in the roaring, and whistling, and whizzing the coffin burst up,\n",
      "and spouted out a thousand peals of laughter.\n",
      "And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and\n",
      "child-sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me.\n",
      "Fearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I cried with\n",
      "horror as I ne’er cried before.\n",
      "But mine own crying awoke me:—and I came to myself.—\n",
      "Thus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent: for as\n",
      "yet he knew not the interpretation thereof. But the disciple whom he\n",
      "loved most arose quickly, seized Zarathustra’s hand, and said:\n",
      "“Thy life itself interpreteth unto us this dream, O Zarathustra!\n",
      "Art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which bursteth\n",
      "open the gates of the fortress of Death?\n",
      "Art thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and\n",
      "angel-caricatures of life?\n",
      "Verily, like a thousand peals of children’s laughter cometh\n",
      "Zarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watchmen and\n",
      "grave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinister keys.\n",
      "With thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: fainting and\n",
      "recovering will demonstrate thy power over them.\n",
      "And when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weariness, even then\n",
      "wilt thou not disappear from our firmament, thou advocate of life!\n",
      "New stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories: verily,\n",
      "laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many-hued\n",
      "canopy.\n",
      "Now will children’s laughter ever from coffins flow; now will a\n",
      "strong wind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weariness: of this\n",
      "thou art thyself the pledge and the prophet!\n",
      "Verily, THEY THEMSELVES DIDST THOU DREAM, thine enemies: that was thy\n",
      "sorest dream.\n",
      "But as thou awokest from them and camest to thyself, so shall they\n",
      "awaken from themselves—and come unto thee!”\n",
      "Thus spake the disciple; and all the others then thronged around\n",
      "Zarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to persuade him to\n",
      "leave his bed and his sadness, and return unto them. Zarathustra,\n",
      "however, sat upright on his couch, with an absent look. Like one\n",
      "returning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples, and\n",
      "examined their features; but still he knew them not. When, however, they\n",
      "raised him, and set him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye\n",
      "changed; he understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard,\n",
      "and said with a strong voice:\n",
      "“Well! this hath just its time; but see to it, my disciples, that we\n",
      "have a good repast; and without delay! Thus do I mean to make amends for\n",
      "bad dreams!\n",
      "The soothsayer, however, shall eat and drink at my side: and verily,\n",
      "I will yet show him a sea in which he can drown himself!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra. Then did he gaze long into the face of the\n",
      "disciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and shook his head.—\n",
      "XLII. REDEMPTION.\n",
      "When Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then did the\n",
      "cripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback spake thus unto\n",
      "him:\n",
      "“Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from thee, and acquire\n",
      "faith in thy teaching: but for them to believe fully in thee, one thing\n",
      "is still needful—thou must first of all convince us cripples! Here hast\n",
      "thou now a fine selection, and verily, an opportunity with more than one\n",
      "forelock! The blind canst thou heal, and make the lame run; and from him\n",
      "who hath too much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a\n",
      "little;—that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples\n",
      "believe in Zarathustra!”\n",
      "Zarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so spake: When one\n",
      "taketh his hump from the hunchback, then doth one take from him his\n",
      "spirit—so do the people teach. And when one giveth the blind man eyes,\n",
      "then doth he see too many bad things on the earth: so that he curseth\n",
      "him who healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, inflicteth\n",
      "upon him the greatest injury; for hardly can he run, when his vices run\n",
      "away with him—so do the people teach concerning cripples. And why should\n",
      "not Zarathustra also learn from the people, when the people learn from\n",
      "Zarathustra?\n",
      "It is, however, the smallest thing unto me since I have been amongst\n",
      "men, to see one person lacking an eye, another an ear, and a third a\n",
      "leg, and that others have lost the tongue, or the nose, or the head.\n",
      "I see and have seen worse things, and divers things so hideous, that\n",
      "I should neither like to speak of all matters, nor even keep silent\n",
      "about some of them: namely, men who lack everything, except that they\n",
      "have too much of one thing—men who are nothing more than a big eye, or a\n",
      "big mouth, or a big belly, or something else big,—reversed cripples, I\n",
      "call such men.\n",
      "And when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time passed\n",
      "over this bridge, then I could not trust mine eyes, but looked again and\n",
      "again, and said at last: “That is an ear! An ear as big as a man!” I\n",
      "looked still more attentively—and actually there did move under the ear\n",
      "something that was pitiably small and poor and slim. And in truth this\n",
      "immense ear was perched on a small thin stalk—the stalk, however, was a\n",
      "man! A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise further\n",
      "a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated soullet dangled at\n",
      "the stalk. The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a\n",
      "man, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when\n",
      "they spake of great men—and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed\n",
      "cripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "When Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and unto those\n",
      "of whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate, then did he turn\n",
      "to his disciples in profound dejection, and said:\n",
      "Verily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and\n",
      "limbs of human beings!\n",
      "This is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man broken up,\n",
      "and scattered about, as on a battle- and butcher-ground.\n",
      "And when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it findeth\n",
      "ever the same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances—but no men!\n",
      "The present and the bygone upon earth—ah! my friends—that is MY most\n",
      "unbearable trouble; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a\n",
      "seer of what is to come.\n",
      "A seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to the\n",
      "future—and alas! also as it were a cripple on this bridge: all that is\n",
      "Zarathustra.\n",
      "And ye also asked yourselves often: “Who is Zarathustra to us? What\n",
      "shall he be called by us?” And like me, did ye give yourselves questions\n",
      "for answers.\n",
      "Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? A\n",
      "harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a healed one?\n",
      "Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a subjugator? A\n",
      "good one? Or an evil one?\n",
      "I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that future which\n",
      "I contemplate.\n",
      "And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect\n",
      "into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance.\n",
      "And how could I endure to be a man, if man were not also the\n",
      "composer, and riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance!\n",
      "To redeem what is past, and to transform every “It was” into “Thus\n",
      "would I have it!”—that only do I call redemption!\n",
      "Will—so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus have I taught\n",
      "you, my friends! But now learn this likewise: the Will itself is still a\n",
      "prisoner.\n",

      "Not the height, it is the declivity that is terrible!\n",
      "The declivity, where the gaze shooteth DOWNWARDS, and the hand\n",
      "graspeth UPWARDS. There doth the heart become giddy through its double\n",

      "To man clingeth my will; with chains do I bind myself to man, because\n",
      "I am pulled upwards to the Superman: for thither doth mine other will\n",
      "tend.\n",

      "that my hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness.\n",
      "I know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often spread around\n",
      "me.\n",
      "I sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask: Who wisheth to deceive\n",
      "me?\n",
      "This is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be deceived,\n",
      "so as not to be on my guard against deceivers.\n",
      "Ah, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be an anchor to\n",
      "my ball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and away!\n",
      "This providence is over my fate, that I have to be without\n",
      "foresight.\n",
      "And he who would not languish amongst men, must learn to drink out of\n",

      "wash himself even with dirty water.\n",
      "And thus spake I often to myself for consolation: “Courage! Cheer up!\n",
      "old heart! An unhappiness hath failed to befall thee: enjoy that as\n",
      "thy—happiness!”\n",
      "This, however, is mine other manly prudence: I am more forbearing to\n",
      "the VAIN than to the proud.\n",
      "Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, however,\n",
      "pride is wounded, there groweth up something better than pride.\n",
      "That life may be fair to behold, its game must be well played; for\n",
      "that purpose, however, it needeth good actors.\n",
      "Good actors have I found all the vain ones: they play, and wish\n",

      "wish.\n",
      "They represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their\n",
      "neighbourhood I like to look upon life—it cureth of melancholy.\n",
      "Therefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the\n",

      "man! I am favourable to him, and sympathetic on account of his\n",
      "modesty.\n",
      "From you would he learn his belief in himself; he feedeth upon your\n",

      "the vain man is unconscious of his modesty!—\n",

      "and rattle-snakes.\n",

      "that is marvellous in the wicked.\n",
      "In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so found I\n",
      "also human wickedness below the fame of it.\n",

      "poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a good\n",
      "hunt!\n",
      "And verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be laughed at,\n",
      "and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called “the\n",
      "devil!”\n",
      "So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the\n",
      "Superman would be FRIGHTFUL in his goodness!\n",
      "And ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar-glow of\n",
      "the wisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his nakedness!\n",
      "Ye highest men who have come within my ken! this is my doubt of you,\n",
      "and my secret laughter: I suspect ye would call my Superman—a devil!\n",
      "Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from their\n",
      "“height” did I long to be up, out, and away to the Superman!\n",
      "A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked: then there\n",
      "grew for me the pinions to soar away into distant futures.\n",
      "Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than ever artist\n",
      "dreamed of: thither, where Gods are ashamed of all clothes!\n",
      "But disguised do I want to see YOU, ye neighbours and fellowmen, and\n",
      "well-attired and vain and estimable, as “the good and just;”—\n",
      "And disguised will I myself sit amongst you—that I may MISTAKE you\n",
      "and myself: for that is my last manly prudence.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XLIV. THE STILLEST HOUR.\n",
      "What hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me troubled, driven\n",
      "forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go—alas, to go away from YOU!\n",
      "Yea, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but\n",
      "unjoyously this time doth the bear go back to his cave!\n",
      "What hath happened unto me? Who ordereth this?—Ah, mine angry\n",
      "mistress wisheth it so; she spake unto me. Have I ever named her name to\n",
      "you?\n",
      "Yesterday towards evening there spake unto me MY STILLEST HOUR: that\n",
      "is the name of my terrible mistress.\n",
      "And thus did it happen—for everything must I tell you, that your\n",
      "heart may not harden against the suddenly departing one!\n",
      "Do ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep?—\n",
      "To the very toes he is terrified, because the ground giveth way under\n",
      "him, and the dream beginneth.\n",
      "This do I speak unto you in parable. Yesterday at the stillest hour\n",
      "did the ground give way under me: the dream began.\n",
      "The hour-hand moved on, the timepiece of my life drew breath—never\n",
      "did I hear such stillness around me, so that my heart was terrified.\n",
      "Then was there spoken unto me without voice: “THOU KNOWEST IT,\n",
      "ZARATHUSTRA?”—\n",
      "And I cried in terror at this whispering, and the blood left my face:\n",
      "but I was silent.\n",
      "Then was there once more spoken unto me without voice: “Thou knowest\n",
      "it, Zarathustra, but thou dost not speak it!”—\n",
      "And at last I answered, like one defiant: “Yea, I know it, but I will\n",
      "not speak it!”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “Thou WILT not,\n",
      "Zarathustra? Is this true? Conceal thyself not behind thy\n",
      "defiance!”—\n",
      "And I wept and trembled like a child, and said: “Ah, I would indeed,\n",
      "but how can I do it! Exempt me only from this! It is beyond my\n",
      "power!”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “What matter about\n",
      "thyself, Zarathustra! Speak thy word, and succumb!”\n",
      "And I answered: “Ah, is it MY word? Who am I? I await the\n",
      "worthier one; I am not worthy even to succumb by it.”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “What matter about\n",
      "thyself? Thou art not yet humble enough for me. Humility hath the\n",
      "hardest skin.”—\n",
      "And I answered: “What hath not the skin of my humility endured! At\n",
      "the foot of my height do I dwell: how high are my summits, no one hath\n",
      "yet told me. But well do I know my valleys.”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “O Zarathustra, he\n",
      "who hath to remove mountains removeth also valleys and plains.”—\n",
      "And I answered: “As yet hath my word not removed mountains, and what\n",
      "I have spoken hath not reached man. I went, indeed, unto men, but not\n",
      "yet have I attained unto them.”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “What knowest thou\n",
      "THEREOF! The dew falleth on the grass when the night is most\n",
      "silent.”—\n",
      "And I answered: “They mocked me when I found and walked in mine own\n",
      "path; and certainly did my feet then tremble.\n",
      "And thus did they speak unto me: Thou forgottest the path before, now\n",
      "dost thou also forget how to walk!”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “What matter about\n",
      "their mockery! Thou art one who hast unlearned to obey: now shalt thou\n",
      "command!\n",
      "Knowest thou not who is most needed by all? He who commandeth great\n",
      "things.\n",
      "To execute great things is difficult: but the more difficult task is\n",
      "to command great things.\n",
      "This is thy most unpardonable obstinacy: thou hast the power, and\n",
      "thou wilt not rule.”—\n",
      "And I answered: “I lack the lion’s voice for all commanding.”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me as a whispering: “It is the\n",
      "stillest words which bring the storm. Thoughts that come with doves’\n",
      "footsteps guide the world.\n",
      "O Zarathustra, thou shalt go as a shadow of that which is to come:\n",
      "thus wilt thou command, and in commanding go foremost.”—\n",
      "And I answered: “I am ashamed.”\n",
      "Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: “Thou must yet\n",
      "become a child, and be without shame.\n",
      "The pride of youth is still upon thee; late hast thou become young:\n",
      "but he who would become a child must surmount even his youth.”—\n",
      "And I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, however, did I\n",
      "say what I had said at first. “I will not.”\n",
      "Then did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how that laughing\n",
      "lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart!\n",
      "And there was spoken unto me for the last time: “O Zarathustra, thy\n",
      "fruits are ripe, but thou art not ripe for thy fruits!\n",
      "So must thou go again into solitude: for thou shalt yet become\n",
      "mellow.”—\n",
      "And again was there a laughing, and it fled: then did it become still\n",
      "around me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, on the ground,\n",
      "and the sweat flowed from my limbs.\n",
      "—Now have ye heard all, and why I have to return into my solitude.\n",
      "Nothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends.\n",
      "But even this have ye heard from me, WHO is still the most reserved\n",
      "of men—and will be so!\n",
      "Ah, my friends! I should have something more to say unto you! I\n",
      "should have something more to give unto you! Why do I not give it? Am I\n",
      "then a niggard?—\n",
      "When, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the violence of\n",
      "his pain, and a sense of the nearness of his departure from his friends\n",
      "came over him, so that he wept aloud; and no one knew how to console\n",
      "him. In the night, however, he went away alone and left his friends.\n",
      "THIRD PART.\n",
      "“Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward\n",
      "because I am exalted.\n",

      "XLV. THE WANDERER.\n",
      "Then, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the\n",
      "ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the\n",
      "other coast; because there he meant to embark. For there was a good\n",
      "roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those\n",
      "ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the\n",
      "Happy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought\n",
      "on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how\n",
      "many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.\n",
      "I am a wanderer and mountain-climber, said he to his heart, I love\n",
      "not the plains, and it seemeth I cannot long sit still.\n",
      "And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience—a wandering\n",
      "will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in the end one experienceth\n",
      "only oneself.\n",
      "The time is now past when accidents could befall me; and what COULD\n",
      "now fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!\n",
      "It returneth only, it cometh home to me at last—mine own Self, and\n",
      "such of it as hath been long abroad, and scattered among things and\n",
      "accidents.\n",
      "And one thing more do I know: I stand now before my last summit, and\n",
      "before that which hath been longest reserved for me. Ah, my hardest path\n",
      "must I ascend! Ah, I have begun my lonesomest wandering!\n",
      "He, however, who is of my nature doth not avoid such an hour: the\n",
      "hour that saith unto him: Now only dost thou go the way to thy\n",
      "greatness! Summit and abyss—these are now comprised together!\n",
      "Thou goest the way to thy greatness: now hath it become thy last\n",
      "refuge, what was hitherto thy last danger!\n",
      "Thou goest the way to thy greatness: it must now be thy best courage\n",
      "that there is no longer any path behind thee!\n",
      "Thou goest the way to thy greatness: here shall no one steal after\n",
      "thee! Thy foot itself hath effaced the path behind thee, and over it\n",
      "standeth written: Impossibility.\n",
      "And if all ladders henceforth fail thee, then must thou learn to\n",
      "mount upon thine own head: how couldst thou mount upward otherwise?\n",
      "Upon thine own head, and beyond thine own heart! Now must the\n",
      "gentlest in thee become the hardest.\n",
      "He who hath always much-indulged himself, sickeneth at last by his\n",

      "To learn TO LOOK AWAY FROM oneself, is necessary in order to see MANY\n",
      "THINGS:—this hardiness is needed by every mountain-climber.\n",
      "He, however, who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner, how can\n",
      "he ever see more of anything than its foreground!\n",
      "But thou, O Zarathustra, wouldst view the ground of everything, and\n",
      "its background: thus must thou mount even above thyself—up, upwards,\n",
      "until thou hast even thy stars UNDER thee!\n",
      "Yea! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: that only\n",
      "would I call my SUMMIT, that hath remained for me as my LAST\n",
      "summit!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his\n",

      "before. And when he had reached the top of the mountain-ridge, behold,\n",
      "there lay the other sea spread out before him: and he stood still and\n",
      "was long silent. The night, however, was cold at this height, and clear\n",
      "and starry.\n",
      "I recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am ready. Now\n",
      "hath my last lonesomeness begun.\n",

      "Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I\n",
      "learn that they come out of the sea.\n",
      "That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of\n",
      "their summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its\n",
      "height.—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was\n",
      "cold: when, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last\n",
      "stood alone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and\n",
      "eagerer than ever before.\n",
      "Everything as yet sleepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily\n",
      "and strangely doth its eye gaze upon me.\n",
      "But it breatheth warmly—I feel it. And I feel also that it dreameth.\n",
      "It tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows.\n",
      "Hark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Or evil\n",
      "expectations?\n",
      "Ah, I am sad along with thee, thou dusky monster, and angry with\n",
      "myself even for thy sake.\n",
      "Ah, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, would I\n",
      "free thee from evil dreams!—\n",
      "And while Zarathustra thus spake, he laughed at himself with\n",
      "melancholy and bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, wilt thou even\n",
      "sing consolation to the sea?\n",
      "Ah, thou amiable fool, Zarathustra, thou too-blindly confiding one!\n",
      "But thus hast thou ever been: ever hast thou approached confidently all\n",
      "that is terrible.\n",
      "Every monster wouldst thou caress. A whiff of warm breath, a little\n",
      "soft tuft on its paw—: and immediately wert thou ready to love and lure\n",
      "it.\n",
      "LOVE is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything, IF IT\n",
      "ONLY LIVE! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in love!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. Then,\n",
      "however, he thought of his abandoned friends—and as if he had done them\n",
      "a wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided himself because of his thoughts.\n",
      "And forthwith it came to pass that the laugher wept—with anger and\n",
      "longing wept Zarathustra bitterly.\n",
      "XLVI. THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "When it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was on board\n",
      "the ship—for a man who came from the Happy Isles had gone on board along\n",
      "with him,—there was great curiosity and expectation. But Zarathustra\n",
      "kept silent for two days, and was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he\n",
      "neither answered looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day,\n",
      "however, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for\n",
      "there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the\n",
      "ship, which came from afar, and was to go still further. Zarathustra,\n",
      "however, was fond of all those who make distant voyages, and dislike to\n",
      "live without danger. And behold! when listening, his own tongue was at\n",
      "last loosened, and the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to\n",
      "speak thus:\n",
      "To you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever hath\n",
      "embarked with cunning sails upon frightful seas,—\n",
      "To you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose souls are\n",
      "allured by flutes to every treacherous gulf:\n",
      "—For ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand; and where ye\n",
      "can DIVINE, there do ye hate to CALCULATE—\n",
      "To you only do I tell the enigma that I SAW—the vision of the\n",
      "lonesomest one.—\n",
      "Gloomily walked I lately in corpse-coloured twilight—gloomily and\n",
      "sternly, with compressed lips. Not only one sun had set for me.\n",
      "A path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, lonesome\n",
      "path, which neither herb nor shrub any longer cheered, a mountain-path,\n",
      "crunched under the daring of my foot.\n",
      "Mutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, trampling the\n",
      "stone that let it slip: thus did my foot force its way upwards.\n",
      "Upwards:—in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, towards the\n",
      "abyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.\n",
      "Upwards:—although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half-mole; paralysed,\n",
      "paralysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts like drops of lead\n",
      "into my brain.\n",
      "“O Zarathustra,” it whispered scornfully, syllable by syllable, “thou\n",
      "stone of wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, but every thrown stone\n",
      "must—fall!\n",
      "O Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou\n",
      "star-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high,—but every thrown\n",
      "stone—must fall!\n",
      "Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zarathustra, far\n",
      "indeed threwest thou thy stone—but upon THYSELF will it recoil!”\n",
      "Then was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, however,\n",
      "oppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily lonesomer than when\n",
      "alone!\n",
      "I ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought,—but everything oppressed\n",
      "me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse\n",
      "dream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.—\n",
      "But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto\n",
      "slain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still\n",
      "and say: “Dwarf! Thou! Or I!”—\n",
      "For courage is the best slayer,—courage which ATTACKETH: for in every\n",
      "attack there is sound of triumph.\n",
      "Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby hath he overcome\n",
      "every animal. With sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain; human\n",
      "pain, however, is the sorest pain.\n",
      "Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth man not\n",
      "stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself—seeing abysses?\n",
      "Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering.\n",
      "Fellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man\n",
      "looketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering.\n",
      "Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it\n",
      "slayeth even death itself; for it saith: “WAS THAT life? Well! Once\n",
      "more!”\n",
      "In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. He who hath\n",
      "ears to hear, let him hear.—\n",
      "2.\n",
      "“Halt, dwarf!” said I. “Either I—or thou! I, however, am the stronger\n",
      "of the two:—thou knowest not mine abysmal thought! IT—couldst thou not\n",
      "endure!”\n",
      "Then happened that which made me lighter: for the dwarf sprang from\n",
      "my shoulder, the prying sprite! And it squatted on a stone in front of\n",
      "me. There was however a gateway just where we halted.\n",
      "“Look at this gateway! Dwarf!” I continued, “it hath two faces. Two\n",
      "roads come together here: these hath no one yet gone to the end of.\n",
      "This long lane backwards: it continueth for an eternity. And that\n",
      "long lane forward—that is another eternity.\n",
      "They are antithetical to one another, these roads; they directly abut\n",
      "on one another:—and it is here, at this gateway, that they come\n",
      "together. The name of the gateway is inscribed above: ‘This Moment.’\n",
      "But should one follow them further—and ever further and further on,\n",
      "thinkest thou, dwarf, that these roads would be eternally\n",
      "antithetical?”—\n",
      "“Everything straight lieth,” murmured the dwarf, contemptuously. “All\n",
      "truth is crooked; time itself is a circle.”\n",
      "“Thou spirit of gravity!” said I wrathfully, “do not take it too\n",
      "lightly! Or I shall let thee squat where thou squattest, Haltfoot,—and I\n",
      "carried thee HIGH!”\n",
      "“Observe,” continued I, “This Moment! From the gateway, This Moment,\n",
      "there runneth a long eternal lane BACKWARDS: behind us lieth an\n",
      "eternity.\n",
      "Must not whatever CAN run its course of all things, have already run\n",
      "along that lane? Must not whatever CAN happen of all things have already\n",
      "happened, resulted, and gone by?\n",
      "And if everything have already existed, what thinkest thou, dwarf, of\n",
      "This Moment? Must not this gateway also—have already existed?\n",
      "And are not all things closely bound together in such wise that This\n",
      "Moment draweth all coming things after it? CONSEQUENTLY—itself also?\n",
      "For whatever CAN run its course of all things, also in this long lane\n",
      "OUTWARD—MUST it once more run!—\n",
      "And this slow spider which creepeth in the moonlight, and this\n",
      "moonlight itself, and thou and I in this gateway whispering together,\n",
      "whispering of eternal things—must we not all have already existed?\n",
      "—And must we not return and run in that other lane out before us,\n",
      "that long weird lane—must we not eternally return?”—\n",
      "Thus did I speak, and always more softly: for I was afraid of mine\n",
      "own thoughts, and arrear-thoughts. Then, suddenly did I hear a dog HOWL\n",
      "near me.\n",
      "Had I ever heard a dog howl thus? My thoughts ran back. Yes! When I\n",
      "was a child, in my most distant childhood:\n",
      "—Then did I hear a dog howl thus. And saw it also, with hair\n",
      "bristling, its head upwards, trembling in the stillest midnight, when\n",
      "even dogs believe in ghosts:\n",
      "—So that it excited my commiseration. For just then went the full\n",
      "moon, silent as death, over the house; just then did it stand still, a\n",
      "glowing globe—at rest on the flat roof, as if on some one’s\n",
      "property:—\n",
      "Thereby had the dog been terrified: for dogs believe in thieves and\n",
      "ghosts. And when I again heard such howling, then did it excite my\n",
      "commiseration once more.\n",
      "Where was now the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the\n",
      "whispering? Had I dreamt? Had I awakened? ‘Twixt rugged rocks did I\n",
      "suddenly stand alone, dreary in the dreariest moonlight.\n",
      "BUT THERE LAY A MAN! And there! The dog leaping, bristling,\n",
      "whining—now did it see me coming—then did it howl again, then did it\n",
      "CRY:—had I ever heard a dog cry so for help?\n",
      "And verily, what I saw, the like had I never seen. A young shepherd\n",
      "did I see, writhing, choking, quivering, with distorted countenance, and\n",
      "with a heavy black serpent hanging out of his mouth.\n",
      "Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?\n",
      "He had perhaps gone to sleep? Then had the serpent crawled into his\n",
      "throat—there had it bitten itself fast.\n",
      "My hand pulled at the serpent, and pulled:—in vain! I failed to pull\n",
      "the serpent out of his throat. Then there cried out of me: “Bite!\n",
      "Bite!\n",
      "Its head off! Bite!”—so cried it out of me; my horror, my hatred, my\n",
      "loathing, my pity, all my good and my bad cried with one voice out of\n",
      "me.—\n",
      "Ye daring ones around me! Ye venturers and adventurers, and whoever\n",
      "of you have embarked with cunning sails on unexplored seas! Ye\n",
      "enigma-enjoyers!\n",
      "Solve unto me the enigma that I then beheld, interpret unto me the\n",
      "vision of the lonesomest one!\n",
      "For it was a vision and a foresight:—WHAT did I then behold in\n",
      "parable? And WHO is it that must come some day?\n",
      "WHO is the shepherd into whose throat the serpent thus crawled? WHO\n",
      "is the man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus\n",
      "crawl?\n",
      "—The shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished him; he bit with a\n",
      "strong bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent—: and sprang\n",
      "up.—\n",
      "No longer shepherd, no longer man—a transfigured being, a\n",
      "light-surrounded being, that LAUGHED! Never on earth laughed a man as HE\n",
      "laughed!\n",
      "O my brethren, I heard a laughter which was no human laughter,—and\n",
      "now gnaweth a thirst at me, a longing that is never allayed.\n",
      "My longing for that laughter gnaweth at me: oh, how can I still\n",
      "endure to live! And how could I endure to die at present!—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "XLVII. INVOLUNTARY BLISS.\n",
      "With such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra sail\n",
      "o’er the sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys from the Happy\n",
      "Isles and from his friends, then had he surmounted all his pain—:\n",
      "triumphantly and with firm foot did he again accept his fate. And then\n",
      "talked Zarathustra in this wise to his exulting conscience:\n",
      "Alone am I again, and like to be so, alone with the pure heaven, and\n",
      "the open sea; and again is the afternoon around me.\n",
      "On an afternoon did I find my friends for the first time; on an\n",
      "afternoon, also, did I find them a second time:—at the hour when all\n",
      "light becometh stiller.\n",

      "now seeketh for lodging a luminous soul: WITH HAPPINESS hath all light\n",
      "now become stiller.\n",
      "O afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend to the\n",
      "valley that it might seek a lodging: then did it find those open\n",
      "hospitable souls.\n",
      "O afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I might have\n",
      "one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, and this dawn of my\n",
      "highest hope!\n",
      "Companions did the creating one once seek, and children of HIS hope:\n",
      "and lo, it turned out that he could not find them, except he himself\n",
      "should first create them.\n",
      "Thus am I in the midst of my work, to my children going, and from\n",
      "them returning: for the sake of his children must Zarathustra perfect\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "For in one’s heart one loveth only one’s child and one’s work; and\n",
      "where there is great love to oneself, then is it the sign of pregnancy:\n",
      "so have I found it.\n",
      "Still are my children verdant in their first spring, standing nigh\n",
      "one another, and shaken in common by the winds, the trees of my garden\n",
      "and of my best soil.\n",
      "And verily, where such trees stand beside one another, there ARE\n",
      "Happy Isles!\n",
      "But one day will I take them up, and put each by itself alone: that\n",
      "it may learn lonesomeness and defiance and prudence.\n",
      "Gnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it then stand by\n",
      "the sea, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.\n",
      "Yonder where the storms rush down into the sea, and the snout of the\n",
      "mountain drinketh water, shall each on a time have his day and night\n",
      "watches, for HIS testing and recognition.\n",
      "Recognised and tested shall each be, to see if he be of my type and\n",
      "lineage:—if he be master of a long will, silent even when he speaketh,\n",
      "and giving in such wise that he TAKETH in giving:—\n",
      "—So that he may one day become my companion, a fellow-creator and\n",
      "fellow-enjoyer with Zarathustra:—such a one as writeth my will on my\n",
      "tables, for the fuller perfection of all things.\n",
      "And for his sake and for those like him, must I perfect MYSELF:\n",
      "therefore do I now avoid my happiness, and present myself to every\n",
      "misfortune—for MY final testing and recognition.\n",
      "And verily, it were time that I went away; and the wanderer’s shadow\n",
      "and the longest tedium and the stillest hour—have all said unto me: “It\n",

      "The word blew to me through the keyhole and said “Come!” The door\n",
      "sprang subtlely open unto me, and said “Go!”\n",
      "But I lay enchained to my love for my children: desire spread this\n",

      "Desiring—that is now for me to have lost myself. I POSSESS YOU, MY\n",

      "My past burst its tomb, many pains buried alive woke up—: fully slept\n",
      "had they merely, concealed in corpse-clothes.\n",

      "to hear thee burrowing, and no longer tremble?\n",
      "To my very throat throbbeth my heart when I hear thee burrowing! Thy\n",

      "enough for my final lion-wantonness and playfulness.\n",
      "Sufficiently formidable unto me hath thy weight ever been: but one\n",

      "O afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O haven upon\n",

      "1.\n",
      "When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go\n",
      "straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and\n",
      "questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself\n",
      "jestingly: “Lo, a river that floweth back unto its source in many\n",
      "windings!” For he wanted to learn what had taken place AMONG MEN during\n",
      "the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when\n",
      "he saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said:\n",
      "“What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them up as its\n",
      "simile!\n",
      "Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that\n",

      "to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others\n",

      "have to stoop—shall no longer have to stoop BEFORE THE SMALL ONES!”—And\n",
      "Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.—\n",

      "Hardly, however, had Zarathustra spoken these words, when he fell\n",
      "down as one dead, and remained long as one dead. When however he again\n",
      "came to himself, then was he pale and trembling, and remained lying; and\n",
      "for long he would neither eat nor drink. This condition continued for\n",
      "seven days; his animals, however, did not leave him day nor night,\n",
      "except that the eagle flew forth to fetch food. And what it fetched and\n",

      "How charming it is that there are words and tones; are not words and\n",

      "himself with them? It is a beautiful folly, speaking; therewith danceth\n",
      "man over everything.\n",

      "That I spake of sacrifices and honey-sacrifices, it was merely a ruse\n",
      "in talking and verily, a useful folly! Here aloft can I now speak freer\n",
      "than in front of mountain-caves and anchorites’ domestic animals.\n",
      "What to sacrifice! I squander what is given me, a squanderer with a\n",
      "thousand hands: how could I call that—sacrificing?\n",
      "And when I desired honey I only desired bait, and sweet mucus and\n",
      "mucilage, for which even the mouths of growling bears, and strange,\n",
      "sulky, evil birds, water:\n",
      "—The best bait, as huntsmen and fishermen require it. For if the\n",
      "world be as a gloomy forest of animals, and a pleasure-ground for all\n",
      "wild huntsmen, it seemeth to me rather—and preferably—a fathomless, rich\n",
      "sea;\n",
      "—A sea full of many-hued fishes and crabs, for which even the Gods\n",
      "might long, and might be tempted to become fishers in it, and casters of\n",
      "nets,—so rich is the world in wonderful things, great and small!\n",
      "Especially the human world, the human sea:—towards IT do I now throw\n",
      "out my golden angle-rod and say: Open up, thou human abyss!\n",
      "Open up, and throw unto me thy fish and shining crabs! With my best\n",
      "bait shall I allure to myself to-day the strangest human fish!\n",
      "—My happiness itself do I throw out into all places far and wide\n",
      "‘twixt orient, noontide, and occident, to see if many human fish will\n",
      "not learn to hug and tug at my happiness;—\n",
      "Until, biting at my sharp hidden hooks, they have to come up unto MY\n",

      "of men.\n",
      "For THIS am I from the heart and from the beginning—drawing,\n",
      "hither-drawing, upward-drawing, upbringing; a drawer, a trainer, a\n",
      "training-master, who not in vain counselled himself once on a time:\n",
      "“Become what thou art!”\n",

      "Therefore do I here wait, crafty and scornful upon high mountains, no\n",
      "impatient one, no patient one; rather one who hath even unlearnt\n",

      "For my fate giveth me time: it hath forgotten me perhaps? Or doth it\n",
      "sit behind a big stone and catch flies?\n",
      "And verily, I am well disposed to mine eternal fate, because it doth\n",
      "not hound and hurry me, but leaveth me time for merriment and mischief;\n",
      "so that I have to-day ascended this high mountain to catch fish.\n",
      "Did ever any one catch fish upon high mountains? And though it be a\n",
      "folly what I here seek and do, it is better so than that down below I\n",

      "“Hearken, else I will scourge you with the scourge of God!”\n",
      "Not that I would have a grudge against such wrathful ones on that\n",

      "Myself, however, and my fate—we do not talk to the Present, neither\n",

      "secure on this ground;\n",
      "—On an eternal ground, on hard primary rock, on this highest,\n",
      "hardest, primary mountain-ridge, unto which all winds come, as unto the\n",
      "storm-parting, asking Where? and Whence? and Whither?\n",
      "Here laugh, laugh, my hearty, healthy wickedness! From high mountains\n",
      "cast down thy glittering scorn-laughter! Allure for me with thy\n",

      "LXII. THE CRY OF DISTRESS.\n",
      "The next day sat Zarathustra again on the stone in front of his cave,\n",
      "whilst his animals roved about in the world outside to bring home new\n",
      "food,—also new honey: for Zarathustra had spent and wasted the old honey\n",
      "to the very last particle. When he thus sat, however, with a stick in\n",
      "his hand, tracing the shadow of his figure on the earth, and\n",
      "reflecting—verily! not upon himself and his shadow,—all at once he\n",
      "startled and shrank back: for he saw another shadow beside his own. And\n",
      "when he hastily looked around and stood up, behold, there stood the\n",
      "soothsayer beside him, the same whom he had once given to eat and drink\n",
      "at his table, the proclaimer of the great weariness, who taught: “All is\n",
      "alike, nothing is worth while, the world is without meaning, knowledge\n",
      "strangleth.” But his face had changed since then; and when Zarathustra\n",
      "looked into his eyes, his heart was startled once more: so much evil\n",
      "announcement and ashy-grey lightnings passed over that countenance.\n",
      "The soothsayer, who had perceived what went on in Zarathustra’s soul,\n",
      "wiped his face with his hand, as if he would wipe out the impression;\n",
      "the same did also Zarathustra. And when both of them had thus silently\n",
      "composed and strengthened themselves, they gave each other the hand, as\n",
      "a token that they wanted once more to recognise each other.\n",
      "“Welcome hither,” said Zarathustra, “thou soothsayer of the great\n",
      "weariness, not in vain shalt thou once have been my messmate and guest.\n",
      "Eat and drink also with me to-day, and forgive it that a cheerful old\n",
      "man sitteth with thee at table!”—“A cheerful old man?” answered the\n",
      "soothsayer, shaking his head, “but whoever thou art, or wouldst be, O\n",
      "Zarathustra, thou hast been here aloft the longest time,—in a little\n",
      "while thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land!”—“Do I then rest on dry\n",
      "land?”—asked Zarathustra, laughing.—“The waves around thy mountain,”\n",
      "answered the soothsayer, “rise and rise, the waves of great distress and\n",
      "affliction: they will soon raise thy bark also and carry thee\n",
      "away.”—Thereupon was Zarathustra silent and wondered.—“Dost thou still\n",
      "hear nothing?” continued the soothsayer: “doth it not rush and roar out\n",
      "of the depth?”—Zarathustra was silent once more and listened: then heard\n",
      "he a long, long cry, which the abysses threw to one another and passed\n",
      "on; for none of them wished to retain it: so evil did it sound.\n",
      "“Thou ill announcer,” said Zarathustra at last, “that is a cry of\n",
      "distress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of a black sea.\n",
      "But what doth human distress matter to me! My last sin which hath been\n",
      "reserved for me,—knowest thou what it is called?”\n",
      "—“PITY!” answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart, and\n",
      "raised both his hands aloft—“O Zarathustra, I have come that I may\n",
      "seduce thee to thy last sin!”—\n",
      "And hardly had those words been uttered when there sounded the cry\n",
      "once more, and longer and more alarming than before—also much nearer.\n",
      "“Hearest thou? Hearest thou, O Zarathustra?” called out the soothsayer,\n",
      "“the cry concerneth thee, it calleth thee: Come, come, come; it is time,\n",
      "it is the highest time!”—\n",
      "Zarathustra was silent thereupon, confused and staggered; at last he\n",
      "asked, like one who hesitateth in himself: “And who is it that there\n",
      "calleth me?”\n",
      "“But thou knowest it, certainly,” answered the soothsayer warmly,\n",
      "“why dost thou conceal thyself? It is THE HIGHER MAN that crieth for\n",
      "thee!”\n",
      "“The higher man?” cried Zarathustra, horror-stricken: “what wanteth\n",
      "HE? What wanteth HE? The higher man! What wanteth he here?”—and his skin\n",
      "covered with perspiration.\n",
      "The soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustra’s alarm, but\n",
      "listened and listened in the downward direction. When, however, it had\n",
      "been still there for a long while, he looked behind, and saw Zarathustra\n",
      "standing trembling.\n",
      "“O Zarathustra,” he began, with sorrowful voice, “thou dost not stand\n",
      "there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy: thou wilt have to dance\n",
      "lest thou tumble down!\n",
      "But although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy\n",
      "side-leaps, no one may say unto me: ‘Behold, here danceth the last\n",
      "joyous man!’\n",
      "In vain would any one come to this height who sought HIM here: caves\n",
      "would he find, indeed, and back-caves, hiding-places for hidden ones;\n",
      "but not lucky mines, nor treasure-chambers, nor new gold-veins of\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "Happiness—how indeed could one find happiness among such buried-alive\n",
      "and solitary ones! Must I yet seek the last happiness on the Happy\n",
      "Isles, and far away among forgotten seas?\n",
      "But all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of service,\n",
      "there are no longer any Happy Isles!”—\n",
      "Thus sighed the soothsayer; with his last sigh, however, Zarathustra\n",
      "again became serene and assured, like one who hath come out of a deep\n",
      "chasm into the light. “Nay! Nay! Three times Nay!” exclaimed he with a\n",
      "strong voice, and stroked his beard—“THAT do I know better! There are\n",
      "still Happy Isles! Silence THEREON, thou sighing sorrow-sack!\n",
      "Cease to splash THEREON, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! Do I not\n",
      "already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?\n",
      "Now do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may again become\n",
      "dry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem to thee discourteous?\n",
      "Here however is MY court.\n",
      "But as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at once in\n",
      "those forests: FROM THENCE came his cry. Perhaps he is there hard beset\n",
      "by an evil beast.\n",
      "He is in MY domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And verily,\n",
      "there are many evil beasts about me.”—\n",
      "With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. Then said the\n",
      "soothsayer: “O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue!\n",
      "I know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather wouldst thou\n",
      "run into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts!\n",
      "But what good-will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have me\n",
      "again: in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a block—and\n",
      "wait for thee!”\n",
      "“So be it!” shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: “and what is\n",
      "mine in my cave belongeth also unto thee, my guest!\n",
      "Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it up, thou\n",
      "growling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the evening we want both to\n",
      "be in good spirits;\n",
      "—In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to an end!\n",
      "And thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing-bear.\n",
      "Thou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! Cheer up,\n",
      "old bear! But I also—am a soothsayer.”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Ere Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and\n",
      "forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right on the path\n",
      "which he was about to descend came two kings walking, bedecked with\n",
      "crowns and purple girdles, and variegated like flamingoes: they drove\n",
      "before them a laden ass. “What do these kings want in my domain?” said\n",
      "Zarathustra in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind\n",
      "a thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said half-aloud,\n",
      "like one speaking only to himself: “Strange! Strange! How doth this\n",
      "harmonise? Two kings do I see—and only one ass!”\n",
      "Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and looked towards\n",
      "the spot whence the voice proceeded, and afterwards looked into each\n",
      "other’s faces. “Such things do we also think among ourselves,” said the\n",
      "king on the right, “but we do not utter them.”\n",
      "The king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and answered:\n",
      "“That may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite who hath lived too\n",
      "long among rocks and trees. For no society at all spoileth also good\n",
      "manners.”\n",
      "“Good manners?” replied angrily and bitterly the other king: “what\n",
      "then do we run out of the way of? Is it not ‘good manners’? Our ‘good\n",
      "society’?\n",
      "Better, verily, to live among anchorites and goatherds, than with our\n",
      "gilded, false, over-rouged populace—though it call itself ‘good\n",
      "society.’\n",
      "—Though it call itself ‘nobility.’ But there all is false and foul,\n",
      "above all the blood—thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers.\n",
      "The best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant,\n",
      "coarse, artful, obstinate and enduring: that is at present the noblest\n",
      "type.\n",
      "The peasant is at present the best; and the peasant type should be\n",
      "master! But it is the kingdom of the populace—I no longer allow anything\n",
      "to be imposed upon me. The populace, however—that meaneth,\n",
      "hodgepodge.\n",
      "Populace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with everything,\n",
      "saint and swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every beast out of Noah’s\n",
      "ark.\n",
      "Good manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No one knoweth\n",
      "any longer how to reverence: it is THAT precisely that we run away from.\n",
      "They are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they gild palm-leaves.\n",
      "This loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have become false,\n",
      "draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors,\n",
      "show-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and whosoever at present\n",
      "trafficketh for power.\n",
      "We ARE NOT the first men—and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of\n",
      "this imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.\n",
      "From the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those bawlers\n",
      "and scribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambition-fidgeting,\n",
      "the bad breath—: fie, to live among the rabble;\n",
      "—Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, loathing!\n",
      "Loathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about us kings!”—\n",
      "“Thine old sickness seizeth thee,” said here the king on the left,\n",
      "“thy loathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou knowest, however, that\n",
      "some one heareth us.”\n",
      "Immediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears and eyes to\n",
      "this talk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced towards the kings, and\n",
      "thus began:\n",
      "“He who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth unto you, is\n",
      "called Zarathustra.\n",
      "I am Zarathustra who once said: ‘What doth it now matter about\n",
      "kings!’ Forgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each other: ‘What doth it\n",
      "matter about us kings!’\n",
      "Here, however, is MY domain and jurisdiction: what may ye be seeking\n",
      "in my domain? Perhaps, however, ye have FOUND on your way what\n",
      "I seek: namely, the higher man.”\n",
      "When the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and said with\n",
      "one voice: “We are recognised!\n",
      "With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness\n",
      "of our hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for lo! we are on our\n",
      "way to find the higher man—\n",
      "—The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. To him do we\n",
      "convey this ass. For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on\n",
      "earth.\n",
      "There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than when the\n",
      "mighty of the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becometh\n",
      "false and distorted and monstrous.\n",
      "And when they are even the last men, and more beast than man, then\n",
      "riseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last saith even the\n",
      "populace-virtue: ‘Lo, I alone am virtue!’”—\n",
      "What have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wisdom in kings! I\n",
      "am enchanted, and verily, I have already promptings to make a rhyme\n",
      "thereon:—\n",
      "—Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one’s\n",
      "ears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears. Well\n",
      "then! Well now!\n",
      "(Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utterance: it\n",
      "said distinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.)\n",
      "‘Twas once—methinks year one of our blessed Lord,—Drunk without wine,\n",
      "the Sybil thus deplored:—“How ill things go! Decline! Decline! Ne’er\n",
      "sank the world so low! Rome now hath turned harlot and harlot-stew,\n",
      "Rome’s Caesar a beast, and God—hath turned Jew!”\n",
      "2.\n",
      "With those rhymes of Zarathustra the kings were delighted; the king\n",
      "on the right, however, said: “O Zarathustra, how well it was that we set\n",
      "out to see thee!\n",
      "For thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror: there\n",
      "lookedst thou with the grimace of a devil, and sneeringly: so that we\n",
      "were afraid of thee.\n",
      "But what good did it do! Always didst thou prick us anew in heart and\n",
      "ear with thy sayings. Then did we say at last: What doth it matter how\n",
      "he look!\n",
      "We must HEAR him; him who teacheth: ‘Ye shall love peace as a means\n",
      "to new wars, and the short peace more than the long!’\n",
      "No one ever spake such warlike words: ‘What is good? To be brave is\n",
      "good. It is the good war that halloweth every cause.’\n",
      "O Zarathustra, our fathers’ blood stirred in our veins at such words:\n",
      "it was like the voice of spring to old wine-casks.\n",
      "When the swords ran among one another like red-spotted serpents, then\n",
      "did our fathers become fond of life; the sun of every peace seemed to\n",
      "them languid and lukewarm, the long peace, however, made them\n",
      "ashamed.\n",
      "How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw on the wall brightly\n",
      "furbished, dried-up swords! Like those they thirsted for war. For a\n",
      "sword thirsteth to drink blood, and sparkleth with desire.”—\n",
      "—When the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the happiness\n",
      "of their fathers, there came upon Zarathustra no little desire to mock\n",
      "at their eagerness: for evidently they were very peaceable kings whom he\n",
      "saw before him, kings with old and refined features. But he restrained\n",
      "himself. “Well!” said he, “thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave\n",
      "of Zarathustra; and this day is to have a long evening! At present,\n",
      "however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you.\n",
      "It will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it: but, to\n",
      "be sure, ye will have to wait long!\n",
      "Well! What of that! Where doth one at present learn better to wait\n",
      "than at courts? And the whole virtue of kings that hath remained unto\n",
      "them—is it not called to-day: ABILITY to wait?”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXIV. THE LEECH.\n",
      "And Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower down, through\n",
      "forests and past moory bottoms; as it happeneth, however, to every one\n",
      "who meditateth upon hard matters, he trod thereby unawares upon a man.\n",
      "And lo, there spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain, and two\n",
      "curses and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his\n",
      "stick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, however,\n",
      "he regained his composure, and his heart laughed at the folly he had\n",
      "just committed.\n",
      "“Pardon me,” said he to the trodden one, who had got up enraged, and\n",
      "had seated himself, “pardon me, and hear first of all a parable.\n",
      "As a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lonesome highway,\n",
      "runneth unawares against a sleeping dog, a dog which lieth in the\n",
      "sun:\n",
      "—As both of them then start up and snap at each other, like deadly\n",
      "enemies, those two beings mortally frightened—so did it happen unto\n",
      "us.\n",
      "And yet! And yet—how little was lacking for them to caress each\n",
      "other, that dog and that lonesome one! Are they not both—lonesome\n",
      "ones!”\n",
      "—“Whoever thou art,” said the trodden one, still enraged, “thou\n",
      "treadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only with thy\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "Lo! am I then a dog?”—And thereupon the sitting one got up, and\n",
      "pulled his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first he had lain\n",
      "outstretched on the ground, hidden and indiscernible, like those who lie\n",
      "in wait for swamp-game.\n",
      "“But whatever art thou about!” called out Zarathustra in alarm, for\n",
      "he saw a deal of blood streaming over the naked arm,—“what hath hurt\n",
      "thee? Hath an evil beast bit thee, thou unfortunate one?”\n",
      "The bleeding one laughed, still angry, “What matter is it to thee!”\n",
      "said he, and was about to go on. “Here am I at home and in my province.\n",
      "Let him question me whoever will: to a dolt, however, I shall hardly\n",
      "answer.”\n",
      "“Thou art mistaken,” said Zarathustra sympathetically, and held him\n",
      "fast; “thou art mistaken. Here thou art not at home, but in my domain,\n",
      "and therein shall no one receive any hurt.\n",
      "Call me however what thou wilt—I am who I must be. I call myself\n",
      "Zarathustra.\n",
      "Well! Up thither is the way to Zarathustra’s cave: it is not\n",
      "far,—wilt thou not attend to thy wounds at my home?\n",
      "It hath gone badly with thee, thou unfortunate one, in this life:\n",
      "first a beast bit thee, and then—a man trod upon thee!”—\n",
      "When however the trodden one had heard the name of Zarathustra he was\n",
      "transformed. “What happeneth unto me!” he exclaimed, “WHO preoccupieth\n",
      "me so much in this life as this one man, namely Zarathustra, and that\n",
      "one animal that liveth on blood, the leech?\n",
      "For the sake of the leech did I lie here by this swamp, like a\n",
      "fisher, and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten ten times,\n",
      "when there biteth a still finer leech at my blood, Zarathustra\n",
      "himself!\n",
      "O happiness! O miracle! Praised be this day which enticed me into the\n",
      "swamp! Praised be the best, the livest cupping-glass, that at present\n",
      "liveth; praised be the great conscience-leech Zarathustra!”—\n",
      "Thus spake the trodden one, and Zarathustra rejoiced at his words and\n",
      "their refined reverential style. “Who art thou?” asked he, and gave him\n",
      "his hand, “there is much to clear up and elucidate between us, but\n",
      "already methinketh pure clear day is dawning.”\n",
      "“I am THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE,” answered he who was asked,\n",
      "“and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one to take it\n",
      "more rigorously, more restrictedly, and more severely than I, except him\n",
      "from whom I learnt it, Zarathustra himself.\n",
      "Better know nothing than half-know many things! Better be a fool on\n",
      "one’s own account, than a sage on other people’s approbation! I—go to\n",
      "the basis:\n",
      "—What matter if it be great or small? If it be called swamp or sky? A\n",
      "handbreadth of basis is enough for me, if it be actually basis and\n",
      "ground!\n",
      "—A handbreadth of basis: thereon can one stand. In the true\n",
      "knowing-knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small.”\n",
      "“Then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech?” asked Zarathustra;\n",
      "“and thou investigatest the leech to its ultimate basis, thou\n",
      "conscientious one?”\n",
      "“O Zarathustra,” answered the trodden one, “that would be something\n",
      "immense; how could I presume to do so!\n",
      "That, however, of which I am master and knower, is the BRAIN of the\n",
      "leech:—that is MY world!\n",
      "And it is also a world! Forgive it, however, that my pride here\n",
      "findeth expression, for here I have not mine equal. Therefore said I:\n",
      "‘here am I at home.’\n",
      "How long have I investigated this one thing, the brain of the leech,\n",
      "so that here the slippery truth might no longer slip from me! Here is MY\n",
      "domain!\n",
      "—For the sake of this did I cast everything else aside, for the sake\n",
      "of this did everything else become indifferent to me; and close beside\n",
      "my knowledge lieth my black ignorance.\n",
      "My spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should be so—that I\n",
      "should know one thing, and not know all else: they are a loathing unto\n",
      "me, all the semi-spiritual, all the hazy, hovering, and visionary.\n",
      "Where mine honesty ceaseth, there am I blind, and want also to be\n",
      "blind. Where I want to know, however, there want I also to be\n",
      "honest—namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel and inexorable.\n",
      "Because THOU once saidest, O Zarathustra: ‘Spirit is life which\n",
      "itself cutteth into life’;—that led and allured me to thy doctrine. And\n",
      "verily, with mine own blood have I increased mine own knowledge!”\n",
      "—“As the evidence indicateth,” broke in Zarathustra; for still was\n",
      "the blood flowing down on the naked arm of the conscientious one. For\n",
      "there had ten leeches bitten into it.\n",
      "“O thou strange fellow, how much doth this very evidence teach\n",
      "me—namely, thou thyself! And not all, perhaps, might I pour into thy\n",
      "rigorous ear!\n",
      "Well then! We part here! But I would fain find thee again. Up thither\n",
      "is the way to my cave: to-night shalt thou there be my welcome\n",
      "guest!\n",
      "Fain would I also make amends to thy body for Zarathustra treading\n",
      "upon thee with his feet: I think about that. Just now, however, a cry of\n",
      "distress calleth me hastily away from thee.”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXV. THE MAGICIAN.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "When however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw he on the\n",
      "same path, not far below him, a man who threw his limbs about like a\n",
      "maniac, and at last tumbled to the ground on his belly. “Halt!” said\n",
      "then Zarathustra to his heart, “he there must surely be the higher man,\n",
      "from him came that dreadful cry of distress,—I will see if I can help\n",
      "him.” When, however, he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground,\n",
      "he found a trembling old man, with fixed eyes; and in spite of all\n",
      "Zarathustra’s efforts to lift him and set him again on his feet, it was\n",
      "all in vain. The unfortunate one, also, did not seem to notice that some\n",
      "one was beside him; on the contrary, he continually looked around with\n",
      "moving gestures, like one forsaken and isolated from all the world. At\n",
      "last, however, after much trembling, and convulsion, and\n",
      "curling-himself-up, he began to lament thus:\n",
      "Who warm’th me, who lov’th me still? Give ardent fingers! Give\n",
      "heartening charcoal-warmers! Prone, outstretched, trembling, Like him,\n",
      "half dead and cold, whose feet one warm’th— And shaken, ah! by\n",

      "mocking eye that me in darkness watcheth: —Thus do I lie, Bend myself,\n",
      "twist myself, convulsed With all eternal torture, And smitten By thee,\n",
      "cruellest huntsman, Thou unfamiliar—GOD... Smite deeper! Smite yet once\n",
      "more! Pierce through and rend my heart! What mean’th this torture With\n",

      "back, Mine unfamiliar God! my PAIN! My final bliss!\n",
      "2.\n",
      "—Here, however, Zarathustra could no longer restrain himself; he took\n",
      "his staff and struck the wailer with all his might. “Stop this,” cried\n",
      "he to him with wrathful laughter, “stop this, thou stage-player! Thou\n",
      "false coiner! Thou liar from the very heart! I know thee well!\n",
      "I will soon make warm legs to thee, thou evil magician: I know well\n",
      "how—to make it hot for such as thou!”\n",
      "—“Leave off,” said the old man, and sprang up from the ground,\n",
      "“strike me no more, O Zarathustra! I did it only for amusement!\n",
      "That kind of thing belongeth to mine art. Thee thyself, I wanted to\n",
      "put to the proof when I gave this performance. And verily, thou hast\n",
      "well detected me!\n",

      "HARD, thou wise Zarathustra! Hard strikest thou with thy ‘truths,’ thy\n",
      "cudgel forceth from me—THIS truth!”\n",
      "—“Flatter not,” answered Zarathustra, still excited and frowning,\n",
      "“thou stage-player from the heart! Thou art false: why speakest thou—of\n",
      "truth!\n",
      "Thou peacock of peacocks, thou sea of vanity; WHAT didst thou\n",
      "represent before me, thou evil magician; WHOM was I meant to believe in\n",
      "when thou wailedst in such wise?”\n",
      "“THE PENITENT IN SPIRIT,” said the old man, “it was him—I\n",
      "represented; thou thyself once devisedst this expression—\n",
      "—The poet and magician who at last turneth his spirit against\n",
      "himself, the transformed one who freezeth to death by his bad science\n",
      "and conscience.\n",
      "And just acknowledge it: it was long, O Zarathustra, before thou\n",
      "discoveredst my trick and lie! Thou BELIEVEDST in my distress when thou\n",
      "heldest my head with both thy hands,—\n",
      "—I heard thee lament ‘we have loved him too little, loved him too\n",
      "little!’ Because I so far deceived thee, my wickedness rejoiced in\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "“Thou mayest have deceived subtler ones than I,” said Zarathustra\n",
      "sternly. “I am not on my guard against deceivers; I HAVE TO BE without\n",
      "precaution: so willeth my lot.\n",
      "Thou, however,—MUST deceive: so far do I know thee! Thou must ever be\n",
      "equivocal, trivocal, quadrivocal, and quinquivocal! Even what thou hast\n",
      "now confessed, is not nearly true enough nor false enough for me!\n",
      "Thou bad false coiner, how couldst thou do otherwise! Thy very malady\n",
      "wouldst thou whitewash if thou showed thyself naked to thy\n",
      "physician.\n",
      "Thus didst thou whitewash thy lie before me when thou saidst: ‘I did\n",
      "so ONLY for amusement!’ There was also SERIOUSNESS therein, thou ART\n",
      "something of a penitent-in-spirit!\n",
      "I divine thee well: thou hast become the enchanter of all the world;\n",
      "but for thyself thou hast no lie or artifice left,—thou art disenchanted\n",
      "to thyself!\n",
      "Thou hast reaped disgust as thy one truth. No word in thee is any\n",
      "longer genuine, but thy mouth is so: that is to say, the disgust that\n",
      "cleaveth unto thy mouth.”—\n",
      "—“Who art thou at all!” cried here the old magician with defiant\n",
      "voice, “who dareth to speak thus unto ME, the greatest man now\n",
      "living?”—and a green flash shot from his eye at Zarathustra. But\n",
      "immediately after he changed, and said sadly:\n",
      "“O Zarathustra, I am weary of it, I am disgusted with mine arts, I am\n",
      "not GREAT, why do I dissemble! But thou knowest it well—I sought for\n",
      "greatness!\n",
      "A great man I wanted to appear, and persuaded many; but the lie hath\n",
      "been beyond my power. On it do I collapse.\n",
      "O Zarathustra, everything is a lie in me; but that I collapse—this my\n",
      "collapsing is GENUINE!”—\n",
      "“It honoureth thee,” said Zarathustra gloomily, looking down with\n",
      "sidelong glance, “it honoureth thee that thou soughtest for greatness,\n",
      "but it betrayeth thee also. Thou art not great.\n",
      "Thou bad old magician, THAT is the best and the honestest thing I\n",
      "honour in thee, that thou hast become weary of thyself, and hast\n",
      "expressed it: ‘I am not great.’\n",
      "THEREIN do I honour thee as a penitent-in-spirit, and although only\n",
      "for the twinkling of an eye, in that one moment wast thou—genuine.\n",
      "But tell me, what seekest thou here in MY forests and rocks? And if\n",
      "thou hast put thyself in MY way, what proof of me wouldst thou\n",
      "have?—\n",
      "—Wherein didst thou put ME to the test?”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and his eyes sparkled. But the old magician\n",
      "kept silence for a while; then said he: “Did I put thee to the test?\n",
      "I—seek only.\n",
      "O Zarathustra, I seek a genuine one, a right one, a simple one, an\n",
      "unequivocal one, a man of perfect honesty, a vessel of wisdom, a saint\n",
      "of knowledge, a great man!\n",
      "Knowest thou it not, O Zarathustra? I SEEK ZARATHUSTRA.”\n",
      "—And here there arose a long silence between them: Zarathustra,\n",
      "however, became profoundly absorbed in thought, so that he shut his\n",
      "eyes. But afterwards coming back to the situation, he grasped the hand\n",
      "of the magician, and said, full of politeness and policy:\n",
      "“Well! Up thither leadeth the way, there is the cave of Zarathustra.\n",
      "In it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst fain find.\n",
      "And ask counsel of mine animals, mine eagle and my serpent: they\n",
      "shall help thee to seek. My cave however is large.\n",
      "I myself, to be sure—I have as yet seen no great man. That which is\n",
      "great, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It is the kingdom\n",
      "of the populace.\n",
      "Many a one have I found who stretched and inflated himself, and the\n",
      "people cried: ‘Behold; a great man!’ But what good do all bellows do!\n",
      "The wind cometh out at last.\n",
      "At last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long: then\n",
      "cometh out the wind. To prick a swollen one in the belly, I call good\n",
      "pastime. Hear that, ye boys!\n",
      "Our to-day is of the populace: who still KNOWETH what is great and\n",
      "what is small! Who could there seek successfully for greatness! A fool\n",
      "only: it succeedeth with fools.\n",
      "Thou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who TAUGHT that to\n",
      "thee? Is to-day the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why dost\n",
      "thou—tempt me?”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went laughing on\n",
      "his way.\n",
      "LXVI. OUT OF SERVICE.\n",
      "Not long, however, after Zarathustra had freed himself from the\n",
      "magician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he\n",
      "followed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, pale countenance:\n",
      "THIS MAN grieved him exceedingly. “Alas,” said he to his heart, “there\n",
      "sitteth disguised affliction; methinketh he is of the type of the\n",
      "priests: what do THEY want in my domain?\n",
      "What! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must another\n",
      "necromancer again run across my path,—\n",
      "—Some sorcerer with laying-on-of-hands, some sombre wonder-worker by\n",
      "the grace of God, some anointed world-maligner, whom, may the devil\n",
      "take!\n",
      "But the devil is never at the place which would be his right place:\n",
      "he always cometh too late, that cursed dwarf and club-foot!”—\n",
      "Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart, and considered how\n",
      "with averted look he might slip past the black man. But behold, it came\n",
      "about otherwise. For at the same moment had the sitting one already\n",
      "perceived him; and not unlike one whom an unexpected happiness\n",
      "overtaketh, he sprang to his feet, and went straight towards\n",
      "Zarathustra.\n",
      "“Whoever thou art, thou traveller,” said he, “help a strayed one, a\n",
      "seeker, an old man, who may here easily come to grief!\n",
      "The world here is strange to me, and remote; wild beasts also did I\n",
      "hear howling; and he who could have given me protection—he is himself no\n",
      "more.\n",
      "I was seeking the pious man, a saint and an anchorite, who, alone in\n",
      "his forest, had not yet heard of what all the world knoweth at\n",
      "present.”\n",
      "“WHAT doth all the world know at present?” asked Zarathustra.\n",
      "“Perhaps that the old God no longer liveth, in whom all the world once\n",
      "believed?”\n",
      "“Thou sayest it,” answered the old man sorrowfully. “And I served\n",
      "that old God until his last hour.\n",
      "Now, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet not free;\n",
      "likewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, except it be in\n",
      "recollections.\n",
      "Therefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might finally\n",
      "have a festival for myself once more, as becometh an old pope and\n",
      "church-father: for know it, that I am the last pope!—a festival of pious\n",
      "recollections and divine services.\n",
      "Now, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, the saint in\n",
      "the forest, who praised his God constantly with singing and\n",
      "mumbling.\n",
      "He himself found I no longer when I found his cot—but two wolves\n",
      "found I therein, which howled on account of his death,—for all animals\n",
      "loved him. Then did I haste away.\n",
      "Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? Then did my\n",
      "heart determine that I should seek another, the most pious of all those\n",
      "who believe not in God—, my heart determined that I should seek\n",
      "Zarathustra!”\n",
      "Thus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood\n",
      "before him. Zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and\n",
      "regarded it a long while with admiration.\n",
      "“Lo! thou venerable one,” said he then, “what a fine and long hand!\n",
      "That is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings. Now, however,\n",
      "doth it hold fast him whom thou seekest, me, Zarathustra.\n",
      "It is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: ‘Who is ungodlier than\n",
      "I, that I may enjoy his teaching?’”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances the thoughts\n",
      "and arrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the latter began:\n",
      "“He who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him\n",
      "most—:\n",
      "—Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? But who\n",
      "could rejoice at that!”—\n",
      "—“Thou servedst him to the last?” asked Zarathustra thoughtfully,\n",
      "after a deep silence, “thou knowest HOW he died? Is it true what they\n",
      "say, that sympathy choked him;\n",
      "—That he saw how MAN hung on the cross, and could not endure it;—that\n",
      "his love to man became his hell, and at last his death?”—\n",
      "The old pope however did not answer, but looked aside timidly, with a\n",
      "painful and gloomy expression.\n",
      "“Let him go,” said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, still\n",
      "looking the old man straight in the eye.\n",
      "“Let him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that thou\n",
      "speakest only in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest as well as I\n",
      "WHO he was, and that he went curious ways.”\n",
      "“To speak before three eyes,” said the old pope cheerfully (he was\n",
      "blind of one eye), “in divine matters I am more enlightened than\n",
      "Zarathustra himself—and may well be so.\n",
      "My love served him long years, my will followed all his will. A good\n",
      "servant, however, knoweth everything, and many a thing even which a\n",

      "He was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not come by his\n",
      "son otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of his faith standeth\n",
      "adultery.\n",
      "Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think highly enough\n",
      "of love itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving\n",
      "one loveth irrespective of reward and requital.\n",
      "When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and\n",
      "revengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his\n",
      "favourites.\n",
      "At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful, more\n",
      "like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old\n",
      "grandmother.\n",
      "There did he sit shrivelled in his chimney-corner, fretting on\n",
      "account of his weak legs, world-weary, will-weary, and one day he\n",
      "suffocated of his all-too-great pity.”—\n",
      "“Thou old pope,” said here Zarathustra interposing, “hast thou seen\n",
      "THAT with thine eyes? It could well have happened in that way: in that\n",
      "way, AND also otherwise. When Gods die they always die many kinds of\n",
      "death.\n",
      "Well! At all events, one way or other—he is gone! He was counter to\n",
      "the taste of mine ears and eyes; worse than that I should not like to\n",
      "say against him.\n",
      "I love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly. But\n",
      "he—thou knowest it, forsooth, thou old priest, there was something of\n",
      "thy type in him, the priest-type—he was equivocal.\n",
      "He was also indistinct. How he raged at us, this wrath-snorter,\n",
      "because we understood him badly! But why did he not speak more\n",
      "clearly?\n",
      "And if the fault lay in our ears, why did he give us ears that heard\n",
      "him badly? If there was dirt in our ears, well! who put it in them?\n",
      "Too much miscarried with him, this potter who had not learned\n",
      "thoroughly! That he took revenge on his pots and creations, however,\n",
      "because they turned out badly—that was a sin against GOOD TASTE.\n",
      "There is also good taste in piety: THIS at last said: ‘Away with SUCH\n",
      "a God! Better to have no God, better to set up destiny on one’s own\n",
      "account, better to be a fool, better to be God oneself!’”\n",
      "—“What do I hear!” said then the old pope, with intent ears; “O\n",
      "Zarathustra, thou art more pious than thou believest, with such an\n",
      "unbelief! Some God in thee hath converted thee to thine ungodliness.\n",
      "Is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee believe in a\n",
      "God? And thine over-great honesty will yet lead thee even beyond good\n",
      "and evil!\n",
      "Behold, what hath been reserved for thee? Thou hast eyes and hands\n",
      "and mouth, which have been predestined for blessing from eternity. One\n",
      "doth not bless with the hand alone.\n",
      "Nigh unto thee, though thou professest to be the ungodliest one, I\n",
      "feel a hale and holy odour of long benedictions: I feel glad and grieved\n",
      "thereby.\n",
      "Let me be thy guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! Nowhere on\n",
      "earth shall I now feel better than with thee!”—\n",
      "“Amen! So shall it be!” said Zarathustra, with great astonishment;\n",
      "“up thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of Zarathustra.\n",
      "Gladly, forsooth, would I conduct thee thither myself, thou venerable\n",
      "one; for I love all pious men. But now a cry of distress calleth me\n",
      "hastily away from thee.\n",
      "In my domain shall no one come to grief; my cave is a good haven. And\n",
      "best of all would I like to put every sorrowful one again on firm land\n",
      "and firm legs.\n",
      "Who, however, could take THY melancholy off thy shoulders? For that I\n",
      "am too weak. Long, verily, should we have to wait until some one\n",
      "re-awoke thy God for thee.\n",
      "For that old God liveth no more: he is indeed dead.”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXVII. THE UGLIEST MAN.\n",
      "—And again did Zarathustra’s feet run through mountains and forests,\n",
      "and his eyes sought and sought, but nowhere was he to be seen whom they\n",
      "wanted to see—the sorely distressed sufferer and crier. On the whole\n",
      "way, however, he rejoiced in his heart and was full of gratitude. “What\n",
      "good things,” said he, “hath this day given me, as amends for its bad\n",
      "beginning! What strange interlocutors have I found!\n",
      "At their words will I now chew a long while as at good corn; small\n",
      "shall my teeth grind and crush them, until they flow like milk into my\n",
      "soul!”—\n",
      "When, however, the path again curved round a rock, all at once the\n",
      "landscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a realm of death. Here\n",
      "bristled aloft black and red cliffs, without any grass, tree, or bird’s\n",
      "voice. For it was a valley which all animals avoided, even the beasts of\n",
      "prey, except that a species of ugly, thick, green serpent came here to\n",
      "die when they became old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley:\n",
      "“Serpent-death.”\n",
      "Zarathustra, however, became absorbed in dark recollections, for it\n",
      "seemed to him as if he had once before stood in this valley. And much\n",
      "heaviness settled on his mind, so that he walked slowly and always more\n",
      "slowly, and at last stood still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes,\n",
      "he saw something sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly\n",
      "like a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came over\n",
      "Zarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such a thing.\n",
      "Blushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he turned aside his\n",
      "glance, and raised his foot that he might leave this ill-starred place.\n",
      "Then, however, became the dead wilderness vocal: for from the ground a\n",
      "noise welled up, gurgling and rattling, as water gurgleth and rattleth\n",
      "at night through stopped-up water-pipes; and at last it turned into\n",
      "human voice and human speech:—it sounded thus:\n",
      "“Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Say, say! WHAT IS THE\n",
      "REVENGE ON THE WITNESS?\n",
      "I entice thee back; here is smooth ice! See to it, see to it, that\n",
      "thy pride doth not here break its legs!\n",
      "Thou thinkest thyself wise, thou proud Zarathustra! Read then the\n",
      "riddle, thou hard nut-cracker,—the riddle that I am! Say then: who am\n",
      "I!”\n",
      "—When however Zarathustra had heard these words,—what think ye then\n",
      "took place in his soul? PITY OVERCAME HIM; and he sank down all at once,\n",
      "like an oak that hath long withstood many tree-fellers,—heavily,\n",
      "suddenly, to the terror even of those who meant to fell it. But\n",
      "immediately he got up again from the ground, and his countenance became\n",
      "stern.\n",
      "“I know thee well,” said he, with a brazen voice, “THOU ART THE\n",
      "MURDERER OF GOD! Let me go.\n",
      "Thou couldst not ENDURE him who beheld THEE,—who ever beheld thee\n",
      "through and through, thou ugliest man. Thou tookest revenge on this\n",
      "witness!”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra and was about to go; but the nondescript\n",
      "grasped at a corner of his garment and began anew to gurgle and seek for\n",
      "words. “Stay,” said he at last—\n",
      "—“Stay! Do not pass by! I have divined what axe it was that struck\n",
      "thee to the ground: hail to thee, O Zarathustra, that thou art again\n",
      "upon thy feet!\n",
      "Thou hast divined, I know it well, how the man feeleth who killed\n",
      "him,—the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here beside me; it is not to no\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "To whom would I go but unto thee? Stay, sit down! Do not however look\n",
      "at me! Honour thus—mine ugliness!\n",
      "They persecute me: now art THOU my last refuge. NOT with their\n",
      "hatred, NOT with their bailiffs;—Oh, such persecution would I mock at,\n",
      "and be proud and cheerful!\n",
      "Hath not all success hitherto been with the well-persecuted ones? And\n",
      "he who persecuteth well learneth readily to be OBSEQUENT—when once he\n",
      "is—put behind! But it is their PITY—\n",
      "—Their pity is it from which I flee away and flee to thee. O\n",
      "Zarathustra, protect me, thou, my last refuge, thou sole one who\n",
      "divinedst me:\n",
      "—Thou hast divined how the man feeleth who killed HIM. Stay! And if\n",
      "thou wilt go, thou impatient one, go not the way that I came. THAT way\n",
      "is bad.\n",
      "Art thou angry with me because I have already racked language too\n",
      "long? Because I have already counselled thee? But know that it is I, the\n",
      "ugliest man,\n",
      "—Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where I have\n",
      "gone, the way is bad. I tread all paths to death and destruction.\n",
      "But that thou passedst me by in silence, that thou blushedst—I saw it\n",
      "well: thereby did I know thee as Zarathustra.\n",
      "Every one else would have thrown to me his alms, his pity, in look\n",
      "and speech. But for that—I am not beggar enough: that didst thou\n",
      "divine.\n",
      "For that I am too RICH, rich in what is great, frightful, ugliest,\n",
      "most unutterable! Thy shame, O Zarathustra, HONOURED me!\n",
      "With difficulty did I get out of the crowd of the pitiful,—that I\n",
      "might find the only one who at present teacheth that ‘pity is\n",
      "obtrusive’— thyself, O Zarathustra!\n",
      "—Whether it be the pity of a God, or whether it be human pity, it is\n",
      "offensive to modesty. And unwillingness to help may be nobler than the\n",
      "virtue that rusheth to do so.\n",
      "THAT however—namely, pity—is called virtue itself at present by all\n",
      "petty people:—they have no reverence for great misfortune, great\n",
      "ugliness, great failure.\n",
      "Beyond all these do I look, as a dog looketh over the backs of\n",
      "thronging flocks of sheep. They are petty, good-wooled, good-willed,\n",
      "grey people.\n",
      "As the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools, with\n",
      "backward-bent head, so do I look at the throng of grey little waves and\n",
      "wills and souls.\n",
      "Too long have we acknowledged them to be right, those petty people:\n",
      "SO we have at last given them power as well;—and now do they teach that\n",
      "‘good is only what petty people call good.’\n",
      "And ‘truth’ is at present what the preacher spake who himself sprang\n",
      "from them, that singular saint and advocate of the petty people, who\n",
      "testified of himself: ‘I—am the truth.’\n",
      "That immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly puffed\n",
      "up,—he who taught no small error when he taught: ‘I—am the truth.’\n",
      "Hath an immodest one ever been answered more courteously?—Thou,\n",
      "however, O Zarathustra, passedst him by, and saidst: ‘Nay! Nay! Three\n",
      "times Nay!’\n",
      "Thou warnedst against his error; thou warnedst—the first to do\n",
      "so—against pity:—not every one, not none, but thyself and thy type.\n",
      "Thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and verily when\n",
      "thou sayest: ‘From pity there cometh a heavy cloud; take heed, ye\n",
      "men!’\n",
      "—When thou teachest: ‘All creators are hard, all great love is beyond\n",
      "their pity:’ O Zarathustra, how well versed dost thou seem to me in\n",
      "weather-signs!\n",
      "Thou thyself, however,—warn thyself also against THY pity! For many\n",
      "are on their way to thee, many suffering, doubting, despairing,\n",
      "drowning, freezing ones—\n",
      "I warn thee also against myself. Thou hast read my best, my worst\n",
      "riddle, myself, and what I have done. I know the axe that felleth\n",
      "thee.\n",
      "But he—HAD TO die: he looked with eyes which beheld EVERYTHING,—he\n",
      "beheld men’s depths and dregs, all his hidden ignominy and ugliness.\n",
      "His pity knew no modesty: he crept into my dirtiest corners. This\n",
      "most prying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful one had to die.\n",
      "He ever beheld ME: on such a witness I would have revenge—or not live\n",
      "myself.\n",
      "The God who beheld everything, AND ALSO MAN: that God had to die! Man\n",
      "cannot ENDURE it that such a witness should live.”\n",
      "Thus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra however got up, and prepared\n",
      "to go on: for he felt frozen to the very bowels.\n",
      "“Thou nondescript,” said he, “thou warnedst me against thy path. As\n",
      "thanks for it I praise mine to thee. Behold, up thither is the cave of\n",
      "Zarathustra.\n",
      "My cave is large and deep and hath many corners; there findeth he\n",
      "that is most hidden his hiding-place. And close beside it, there are a\n",
      "hundred lurking-places and by-places for creeping, fluttering, and\n",
      "hopping creatures.\n",
      "Thou outcast, who hast cast thyself out, thou wilt not live amongst\n",
      "men and men’s pity? Well then, do like me! Thus wilt thou learn also\n",
      "from me; only the doer learneth.\n",
      "And talk first and foremost to mine animals! The proudest animal and\n",
      "the wisest animal—they might well be the right counsellors for us\n",
      "both!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra and went his way, more thoughtfully and slowly\n",
      "even than before: for he asked himself many things, and hardly knew what\n",
      "to answer.\n",
      "“How poor indeed is man,” thought he in his heart, “how ugly, how\n",
      "wheezy, how full of hidden shame!\n",
      "They tell me that man loveth himself. Ah, how great must that\n",
      "self-love be! How much contempt is opposed to it!\n",
      "Even this man hath loved himself, as he hath despised himself,—a\n",
      "great lover methinketh he is, and a great despiser.\n",
      "No one have I yet found who more thoroughly despised himself: even\n",
      "THAT is elevation. Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I\n",
      "heard?\n",
      "I love the great despisers. Man is something that hath to be\n",
      "surpassed.”—\n",
      "LXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.\n",
      "When Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt\n",
      "lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so\n",
      "that even his limbs became colder thereby. When, however, he wandered on\n",
      "and on, uphill and down, at times past green meadows, though also\n",
      "sometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient\n",
      "brook had made its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“What hath happened unto me?” he asked himself, “something warm and\n",
      "living quickeneth me; it must be in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "Already am I less alone; unconscious companions and brethren rove\n",
      "around me; their warm breath toucheth my soul.”\n",
      "When, however, he spied about and sought for the comforters of his\n",
      "lonesomeness, behold, there were kine there standing together on an\n",
      "eminence, whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart. The kine,\n",
      "however, seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him\n",
      "who approached. When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them,\n",
      "then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the\n",
      "kine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the\n",
      "speaker.\n",
      "Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside; for he\n",
      "feared that some one had here met with harm, which the pity of the kine\n",
      "would hardly be able to relieve. But in this he was deceived; for\n",
      "behold, there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading the\n",
      "animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and\n",
      "Preacher-on-the-Mount, out of whose eyes kindness itself preached. “What\n",
      "dost thou seek here?” called out Zarathustra in astonishment.\n",
      "“What do I here seek?” answered he: “the same that thou seekest, thou\n",
      "mischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon earth.\n",
      "To that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For I tell\n",
      "thee that I have already talked half a morning unto them, and just now\n",
      "were they about to give me their answer. Why dost thou disturb them?\n",
      "Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter\n",
      "into the kingdom of heaven. For we ought to learn from them one thing:\n",
      "ruminating.\n",
      "And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, and yet not\n",
      "learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit him! He would not be\n",
      "rid of his affliction,\n",
      "—His great affliction: that, however, is at present called DISGUST.\n",
      "Who hath not at present his heart, his mouth and his eyes full of\n",
      "disgust? Thou also! Thou also! But behold these kine!”—\n",
      "Thus spake the Preacher-on-the-Mount, and turned then his own look\n",
      "towards Zarathustra—for hitherto it had rested lovingly on the kine—:\n",
      "then, however, he put on a different expression. “Who is this with whom\n",
      "I talk?” he exclaimed frightened, and sprang up from the ground.\n",
      "“This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra himself, the\n",
      "surmounter of the great disgust, this is the eye, this is the mouth,\n",
      "this is the heart of Zarathustra himself.”\n",
      "And whilst he thus spake he kissed with o’erflowing eyes the hands of\n",
      "him with whom he spake, and behaved altogether like one to whom a\n",
      "precious gift and jewel hath fallen unawares from heaven. The kine,\n",
      "however, gazed at it all and wondered.\n",
      "“Speak not of me, thou strange one; thou amiable one!” said\n",
      "Zarathustra, and restrained his affection, “speak to me firstly of\n",
      "thyself! Art thou not the voluntary beggar who once cast away great\n",
      "riches,—\n",
      "—Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the\n",
      "poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart? But they\n",
      "received him not.”\n",
      "“But they received me not,” said the voluntary beggar, “thou knowest\n",
      "it, forsooth. So I went at last to the animals and to those kine.”\n",
      "“Then learnedst thou,” interrupted Zarathustra, “how much harder it\n",
      "is to give properly than to take properly, and that bestowing well is an\n",
      "ART—the last, subtlest master-art of kindness.”\n",
      "“Especially nowadays,” answered the voluntary beggar: “at present,\n",
      "that is to say, when everything low hath become rebellious and exclusive\n",
      "and haughty in its manner—in the manner of the populace.\n",
      "For the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the great,\n",
      "evil, long, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth and\n",
      "extendeth!\n",
      "Now doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and petty\n",
      "giving; and the over-rich may be on their guard!\n",
      "Whoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too-small\n",
      "necks:—of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks.\n",
      "Wanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace-pride: all\n",
      "these struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.\n",
      "The kingdom of heaven, however, is with the kine.”\n",
      "“And why is it not with the rich?” asked Zarathustra temptingly,\n",
      "while he kept back the kine which sniffed familiarly at the peaceful\n",
      "one.\n",
      "“Why dost thou tempt me?” answered the other. “Thou knowest it\n",
      "thyself better even than I. What was it drove me to the poorest, O\n",
      "Zarathustra? Was it not my disgust at the richest?\n",
      "—At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who\n",
      "pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish—at this rabble that stinketh\n",
      "to heaven,\n",
      "—At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were pickpockets,\n",
      "or carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives compliant, lewd and\n",
      "forgetful:—for they are all of them not far different from harlots—\n",
      "Populace above, populace below! What are ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ at\n",
      "present! That distinction did I unlearn,—then did I flee away further\n",
      "and ever further, until I came to those kine.”\n",
      "Thus spake the peaceful one, and puffed himself and perspired with\n",
      "his words: so that the kine wondered anew. Zarathustra, however, kept\n",
      "looking into his face with a smile, all the time the man talked so\n",
      "severely—and shook silently his head.\n",
      "“Thou doest violence to thyself, thou Preacher-on-the-Mount, when\n",
      "thou usest such severe words. For such severity neither thy mouth nor\n",
      "thine eye have been given thee.\n",
      "Nor, methinketh, hath thy stomach either: unto IT all such rage and\n",
      "hatred and foaming-over is repugnant. Thy stomach wanteth softer things:\n",
      "thou art not a butcher.\n",
      "Rather seemest thou to me a plant-eater and a root-man. Perhaps thou\n",
      "grindest corn. Certainly, however, thou art averse to fleshly joys, and\n",
      "thou lovest honey.”\n",
      "“Thou hast divined me well,” answered the voluntary beggar, with\n",
      "lightened heart. “I love honey, I also grind corn; for I have sought out\n",
      "what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath:\n",
      "—Also what requireth a long time, a day’s-work and a mouth’s-work for\n",
      "gentle idlers and sluggards.\n",
      "Furthest, to be sure, have those kine carried it: they have devised\n",
      "ruminating and lying in the sun. They also abstain from all heavy\n",
      "thoughts which inflate the heart.”\n",
      "—“Well!” said Zarathustra, “thou shouldst also see MINE animals, mine\n",
      "eagle and my serpent,—their like do not at present exist on earth.\n",
      "Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be to-night its guest.\n",
      "And talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals,—\n",
      "—Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress calleth me\n",
      "hastily away from thee. Also, shouldst thou find new honey with me,\n",
      "ice-cold, golden-comb-honey, eat it!\n",
      "Now, however, take leave at once of thy kine, thou strange one! thou\n",
      "amiable one! though it be hard for thee. For they are thy warmest\n",
      "friends and preceptors!”—\n",
      "—“One excepted, whom I hold still dearer,” answered the voluntary\n",
      "beggar. “Thou thyself art good, O Zarathustra, and better even than a\n",
      "cow!”\n",
      "“Away, away with thee! thou evil flatterer!” cried Zarathustra\n",
      "mischievously, “why dost thou spoil me with such praise and\n",
      "flattery-honey?\n",
      "“Away, away from me!” cried he once more, and heaved his stick at the\n",
      "fond beggar, who, however, ran nimbly away.\n",
      "LXIX. THE SHADOW.\n",
      "Scarcely however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste, and\n",
      "Zarathustra again alone, when he heard behind him a new voice which\n",
      "called out: “Stay! Zarathustra! Do wait! It is myself, forsooth, O\n",
      "Zarathustra, myself, thy shadow!” But Zarathustra did not wait; for a\n",
      "sudden irritation came over him on account of the crowd and the crowding\n",
      "in his mountains. “Whither hath my lonesomeness gone?” spake he.\n",
      "“It is verily becoming too much for me; these mountains swarm; my\n",
      "kingdom is no longer of THIS world; I require new mountains.\n",
      "My shadow calleth me? What matter about my shadow! Let it run after\n",
      "me! I—run away from it.”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra to his heart and ran away. But the one behind\n",
      "followed after him, so that immediately there were three runners, one\n",
      "after the other—namely, foremost the voluntary beggar, then Zarathustra,\n",
      "and thirdly, and hindmost, his shadow. But not long had they run thus\n",
      "when Zarathustra became conscious of his folly, and shook off with one\n",
      "jerk all his irritation and detestation.\n",
      "“What!” said he, “have not the most ludicrous things always happened\n",
      "to us old anchorites and saints?\n",
      "Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do I hear six\n",
      "old fools’ legs rattling behind one another!\n",
      "But doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? Also,\n",
      "methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine.”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and entrails, he\n",
      "stood still and turned round quickly—and behold, he almost thereby threw\n",
      "his shadow and follower to the ground, so closely had the latter\n",
      "followed at his heels, and so weak was he. For when Zarathustra\n",
      "scrutinised him with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden\n",
      "apparition, so slender, swarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower\n",
      "appear.\n",
      "“Who art thou?” asked Zarathustra vehemently, “what doest thou here?\n",
      "And why callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art not pleasing unto\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "“Forgive me,” answered the shadow, “that it is I; and if I please\n",
      "thee not—well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee and thy good\n",
      "taste.\n",
      "A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always on the\n",
      "way, but without a goal, also without a home: so that verily, I lack\n",
      "little of being the eternally Wandering Jew, except that I am not\n",
      "eternal and not a Jew.\n",
      "What? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, unsettled,\n",
      "driven about? O earth, thou hast become too round for me!\n",
      "On every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I fallen\n",
      "asleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh from me, nothing\n",
      "giveth; I become thin—I am almost equal to a shadow.\n",
      "After thee, however, O Zarathustra, did I fly and hie longest; and\n",
      "though I hid myself from thee, I was nevertheless thy best shadow:\n",
      "wherever thou hast sat, there sat I also.\n",
      "With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like\n",
      "a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.\n",
      "With thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst and the\n",
      "furthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is that I have\n",
      "had no fear of any prohibition.\n",
      "With thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all\n",
      "boundary-stones and statues have I o’erthrown; the most dangerous wishes\n",
      "did I pursue,—verily, beyond every crime did I once go.\n",
      "With thee did I unlearn the belief in words and worths and in great\n",
      "names. When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his name also fall\n",
      "away? It is also skin. The devil himself is perhaps—skin.\n",
      "‘Nothing is true, all is permitted’: so said I to myself. Into the\n",
      "coldest water did I plunge with head and heart. Ah, how oft did I stand\n",
      "there naked on that account, like a red crab!\n",
      "Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my\n",
      "belief in the good! Ah, where is the lying innocence which I once\n",
      "possessed, the innocence of the good and of their noble lies!\n",
      "Too oft, verily, did I follow close to the heels of truth: then did\n",
      "it kick me on the face. Sometimes I meant to lie, and behold! then only\n",
      "did I hit—the truth.\n",
      "Too much hath become clear unto me: now it doth not concern me any\n",
      "more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love,—how should I still love\n",
      "myself?\n",
      "‘To live as I incline, or not to live at all’: so do I wish; so\n",
      "wisheth also the holiest. But alas! how have I\n",
      "still—inclination?\n",
      "Have I—still a goal? A haven towards which MY sail is\n",
      "set?\n",
      "A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth WHITHER he saileth, knoweth what\n",
      "wind is good, and a fair wind for him.\n",
      "What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; an unstable\n",
      "will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone.\n",
      "This seeking for MY home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know that this\n",
      "seeking hath been MY home-sickening; it eateth me up.\n",
      "‘WHERE is—MY home?’ For it do I ask and seek, and have sought, but\n",
      "have not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal nowhere, O\n",
      "eternal—in-vain!”\n",
      "Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra’s countenance lengthened at\n",
      "his words. “Thou art my shadow!” said he at last sadly.\n",
      "“Thy danger is not small, thou free spirit and wanderer! Thou hast\n",
      "had a bad day: see that a still worse evening doth not overtake\n",
      "thee!\n",
      "To such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at last even a prisoner\n",
      "blessed. Didst thou ever see how captured criminals sleep? They sleep\n",
      "quietly, they enjoy their new security.\n",
      "Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, rigorous\n",
      "delusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and\n",
      "tempteth thee.\n",
      "Thou hast lost thy goal. Alas, how wilt thou forego and forget that\n",
      "loss? Thereby—hast thou also lost thy way!\n",
      "Thou poor rover and rambler, thou tired butterfly! wilt thou have a\n",
      "rest and a home this evening? Then go up to my cave!\n",
      "Thither leadeth the way to my cave. And now will I run quickly away\n",
      "from thee again. Already lieth as it were a shadow upon me.\n",
      "I will run alone, so that it may again become bright around me.\n",
      "Therefore must I still be a long time merrily upon my legs. In the\n",
      "evening, however, there will be—dancing with me!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXX. NOONTIDE.\n",
      "—And Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, and was alone\n",
      "and ever found himself again; he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude, and\n",
      "thought of good things—for hours. About the hour of noontide, however,\n",
      "when the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra’s head, he passed an old,\n",
      "bent and gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of a\n",
      "vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow grapes in\n",
      "abundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt inclined to quench a\n",
      "little thirst, and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes. When,\n",
      "however, he had already his arm outstretched for that purpose, he felt\n",
      "still more inclined for something else—namely, to lie down beside the\n",
      "tree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep.\n",
      "This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground\n",
      "in the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, than he had\n",
      "forgotten his little thirst, and fell asleep. For as the proverb of\n",
      "Zarathustra saith: “One thing is more necessary than the other.” Only\n",
      "that his eyes remained open:—for they never grew weary of viewing and\n",
      "admiring the tree and the love of the vine. In falling asleep, however,\n",
      "Zarathustra spake thus to his heart:\n",
      "“Hush! Hush! Hath not the world now become perfect? What hath\n",
      "happened unto me?\n",
      "As a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas, light,\n",
      "feather-light, so—danceth sleep upon me.\n",
      "No eye doth it close to me, it leaveth my soul awake. Light is it,\n",
      "verily, feather-light.\n",
      "It persuadeth me, I know not how, it toucheth me inwardly with a\n",
      "caressing hand, it constraineth me. Yea, it constraineth me, so that my\n",
      "soul stretcheth itself out:—\n",
      "—How long and weary it becometh, my strange soul! Hath a seventh-day\n",
      "evening come to it precisely at noontide? Hath it already wandered too\n",
      "long, blissfully, among good and ripe things?\n",
      "It stretcheth itself out, long—longer! it lieth still, my strange\n",
      "soul. Too many good things hath it already tasted; this golden sadness\n",
      "oppresseth it, it distorteth its mouth.\n",
      "—As a ship that putteth into the calmest cove:—it now draweth up to\n",
      "the land, weary of long voyages and uncertain seas. Is not the land more\n",
      "faithful?\n",
      "As such a ship huggeth the shore, tuggeth the shore:—then it\n",
      "sufficeth for a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the land. No\n",
      "stronger ropes are required there.\n",
      "As such a weary ship in the calmest cove, so do I also now repose,\n",
      "nigh to the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, bound to it with the\n",
      "lightest threads.\n",
      "O happiness! O happiness! Wilt thou perhaps sing, O my soul? Thou\n",
      "liest in the grass. But this is the secret, solemn hour, when no\n",
      "shepherd playeth his pipe.\n",
      "Take care! Hot noontide sleepeth on the fields. Do not sing! Hush!\n",
      "The world is perfect.\n",
      "Do not sing, thou prairie-bird, my soul! Do not even whisper!\n",
      "Lo—hush! The old noontide sleepeth, it moveth its mouth: doth it not\n",
      "just now drink a drop of happiness—\n",
      "—An old brown drop of golden happiness, golden wine? Something\n",
      "whisketh over it, its happiness laugheth. Thus—laugheth a God.\n",
      "Hush!—\n",
      "—‘For happiness, how little sufficeth for happiness!’ Thus spake I\n",
      "once and thought myself wise. But it was a blasphemy: THAT have I now\n",
      "learned. Wise fools speak better.\n",
      "The least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest thing, a\n",
      "lizard’s rustling, a breath, a whisk, an eye-glance—LITTLE maketh up the\n",
      "BEST happiness. Hush!\n",
      "—What hath befallen me: Hark! Hath time flown away? Do I not fall?\n",
      "Have I not fallen—hark! into the well of eternity?\n",
      "—What happeneth to me? Hush! It stingeth me—alas—to the heart? To the\n",
      "heart! Oh, break up, break up, my heart, after such happiness, after\n",
      "such a sting!\n",
      "—What? Hath not the world just now become perfect? Round and ripe?\n",
      "Oh, for the golden round ring—whither doth it fly? Let me run after it!\n",
      "Quick!\n",
      "Hush—” (and here Zarathustra stretched himself, and felt that he was\n",
      "asleep.)\n",
      "“Up!” said he to himself, “thou sleeper! Thou noontide sleeper! Well\n",
      "then, up, ye old legs! It is time and more than time; many a good\n",
      "stretch of road is still awaiting you—\n",
      "Now have ye slept your fill; for how long a time? A half-eternity!\n",
      "Well then, up now, mine old heart! For how long after such a sleep\n",
      "mayest thou—remain awake?”\n",
      "(But then did he fall asleep anew, and his soul spake against him and\n",
      "defended itself, and lay down again)—“Leave me alone! Hush! Hath not the\n",
      "world just now become perfect? Oh, for the golden round ball!—\n",
      "“Get up,” said Zarathustra, “thou little thief, thou sluggard! What!\n",
      "Still stretching thyself, yawning, sighing, falling into deep wells?\n",
      "Who art thou then, O my soul!” (and here he became frightened, for a\n",
      "sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face.)\n",
      "“O heaven above me,” said he sighing, and sat upright, “thou gazest\n",
      "at me? Thou hearkenest unto my strange soul?\n",
      "When wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon all earthly\n",
      "things,—when wilt thou drink this strange soul—\n",
      "—When, thou well of eternity! thou joyous, awful, noontide abyss!\n",
      "when wilt thou drink my soul back into thee?”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and rose from his couch beside the tree, as\n",
      "if awakening from a strange drunkenness: and behold! there stood the sun\n",
      "still exactly above his head. One might, however, rightly infer\n",
      "therefrom that Zarathustra had not then slept long.\n",
      "LXXI. THE GREETING.\n",
      "It was late in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long\n",
      "useless searching and strolling about, again came home to his cave.\n",
      "When, however, he stood over against it, not more than twenty paces\n",
      "therefrom, the thing happened which he now least of all expected: he\n",
      "heard anew the great CRY OF DISTRESS. And extraordinary! this time the\n",
      "cry came out of his own cave. It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and\n",
      "Zarathustra plainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices:\n",
      "although heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single\n",
      "mouth.\n",
      "Thereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, and behold! what a\n",
      "spectacle awaited him after that concert! For there did they all sit\n",
      "together whom he had passed during the day: the king on the right and\n",
      "the king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary beggar,\n",
      "the shadow, the intellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful\n",
      "soothsayer, and the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on\n",
      "his head, and had put round him two purple girdles,—for he liked, like\n",
      "all ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome person. In the\n",
      "midst, however, of that sorrowful company stood Zarathustra’s eagle,\n",
      "ruffled and disquieted, for it had been called upon to answer too much\n",
      "for which its pride had not any answer; the wise serpent however hung\n",
      "round its neck.\n",
      "All this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; then however\n",
      "he scrutinised each individual guest with courteous curiosity, read\n",
      "their souls and wondered anew. In the meantime the assembled ones had\n",
      "risen from their seats, and waited with reverence for Zarathustra to\n",
      "speak. Zarathustra however spake thus:\n",
      "“Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was YOUR cry of distress\n",
      "that I heard? And now do I know also where he is to be sought, whom I\n",
      "have sought for in vain to-day: THE HIGHER MAN—:\n",
      "—In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man! But why do I wonder!\n",
      "Have not I myself allured him to me by honey-offerings and artful\n",
      "lure-calls of my happiness?\n",
      "But it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for company: ye make\n",
      "one another’s hearts fretful, ye that cry for help, when ye sit here\n",
      "together? There is one that must first come,\n",
      "—One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial buffoon, a\n",
      "dancer, a wind, a wild romp, some old fool:—what think ye?\n",
      "Forgive me, however, ye despairing ones, for speaking such trivial\n",
      "words before you, unworthy, verily, of such guests! But ye do not divine\n",
      "WHAT maketh my heart wanton:—\n",
      "—Ye yourselves do it, and your aspect, forgive it me! For every one\n",
      "becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing one. To encourage a\n",
      "despairing one—every one thinketh himself strong enough to do so.\n",
      "To myself have ye given this power,—a good gift, mine honourable\n",
      "guests! An excellent guest’s-present! Well, do not then upbraid when I\n",
      "also offer you something of mine.\n",
      "This is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, however,\n",
      "shall this evening and to-night be yours. Mine animals shall serve you:\n",
      "let my cave be your resting-place!\n",
      "At house and home with me shall no one despair: in my purlieus do I\n",
      "protect every one from his wild beasts. And that is the first thing\n",
      "which I offer you: security!\n",
      "The second thing, however, is my little finger. And when ye have\n",
      "THAT, then take the whole hand also, yea, and the heart with it! Welcome\n",
      "here, welcome to you, my guests!”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mischief. After\n",
      "this greeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent;\n",
      "the king on the right, however, answered him in their name.\n",
      "“O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and\n",
      "thy greeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou hast humbled\n",
      "thyself before us; almost hast thou hurt our reverence—:\n",
      "—Who however could have humbled himself as thou hast done, with such\n",
      "pride? THAT uplifteth us ourselves; a refreshment is it, to our eyes and\n",
      "hearts.\n",
      "To behold this, merely, gladly would we ascend higher mountains than\n",
      "this. For as eager beholders have we come; we wanted to see what\n",
      "brighteneth dim eyes.\n",
      "And lo! now is it all over with our cries of distress. Now are our\n",
      "minds and hearts open and enraptured. Little is lacking for our spirits\n",
      "to become wanton.\n",
      "There is nothing, O Zarathustra, that groweth more pleasingly on\n",
      "earth than a lofty, strong will: it is the finest growth. An entire\n",
      "landscape refresheth itself at one such tree.\n",
      "To the pine do I compare him, O Zarathustra, which groweth up like\n",
      "thee—tall, silent, hardy, solitary, of the best, supplest wood,\n",
      "stately,—\n",
      "—In the end, however, grasping out for ITS dominion with strong,\n",
      "green branches, asking weighty questions of the wind, the storm, and\n",
      "whatever is at home on high places;\n",
      "—Answering more weightily, a commander, a victor! Oh! who should not\n",
      "ascend high mountains to behold such growths?\n",
      "At thy tree, O Zarathustra, the gloomy and ill-constituted also\n",
      "refresh themselves; at thy look even the wavering become steady and heal\n",
      "their hearts.\n",
      "And verily, towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes turn\n",
      "to-day; a great longing hath arisen, and many have learned to ask: ‘Who\n",
      "is Zarathustra?’\n",
      "And those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped thy song and\n",
      "thy honey: all the hidden ones, the lone-dwellers and the\n",
      "twain-dwellers, have simultaneously said to their hearts:\n",
      "‘Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to live,\n",
      "everything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else—we must live\n",
      "with Zarathustra!’\n",
      "‘Why doth he not come who hath so long announced himself?’ thus do\n",
      "many people ask; ‘hath solitude swallowed him up? Or should we perhaps\n",
      "go to him?’\n",
      "Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and\n",
      "breaketh open, like a grave that breaketh open and can no longer hold\n",
      "its dead. Everywhere one seeth resurrected ones.\n",
      "Now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O Zarathustra.\n",
      "And however high be thy height, many of them must rise up to thee: thy\n",
      "boat shall not rest much longer on dry ground.\n",
      "And that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, and already\n",
      "no longer despair:—it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones\n",
      "are on the way to thee,—\n",
      "—For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last remnant of God\n",
      "among men—that is to say, all the men of great longing, of great\n",
      "loathing, of great satiety,\n",
      "—All who do not want to live unless they learn again to HOPE—unless\n",
      "they learn from thee, O Zarathustra, the GREAT hope!”\n",
      "Thus spake the king on the right, and seized the hand of Zarathustra\n",
      "in order to kiss it; but Zarathustra checked his veneration, and stepped\n",
      "back frightened, fleeing as it were, silently and suddenly into the far\n",
      "distance. After a little while, however, he was again at home with his\n",
      "guests, looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said:\n",

      "(Thus spake the soothsayer. When Zarathustra’s animals, however,\n",
      "heard these words, they ran away in terror. For they saw that all they\n",

      "“Likewise perishing of thirst,” continued the soothsayer. “And\n",

      "On this occasion, when the soothsayer was longing for wine, it\n",
      "happened that the king on the left, the silent one, also found\n",
      "expression for once. “WE took care,” said he, “about wine, I, along with\n",

      "“Bread,” replied Zarathustra, laughing when he spake, “it is\n",

      "alone, but also by the flesh of good lambs, of which I have two:\n",
      "—THESE shall we slaughter quickly, and cook spicily with sage: it is\n",
      "so that I like them. And there is also no lack of roots and fruits, good\n",

      "with Zarathustra even a king may be a cook.”\n",
      "This proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them, save that the\n",
      "voluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and spices.\n",
      "“Just hear this glutton Zarathustra!” said he jokingly: “doth one go\n",
      "into caves and high mountains to make such repasts?\n",
      "Now indeed do I understand what he once taught us: Blessed be\n",
      "moderate poverty!’ And why he wisheth to do away with beggars.”\n",
      "“Be of good cheer,” replied Zarathustra, “as I am. Abide by thy\n",

      "I am a law only for mine own; I am not a law for all. He, however,\n",

      "Thus spake Zarathustra; the king on the right however answered and\n",

      "yourselves before me!\n",
      "How the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and wickedness,\n",

      "all childishness is carried on. Cool down, here outside, your hot\n",

      "have become men,—SO WE WANT THE KINGDOM OF EARTH.”\n",

      "—Since ye have again become joyful! Ye have, verily, all blossomed\n",
      "forth: it seemeth to me that for such flowers as you, NEW FESTIVALS are\n",

      "ye devise when with me, that do I take as a good omen,—such things only\n",
      "the convalescents devise!\n",
      "And should ye celebrate it again, this ass-festival, do it from love\n",
      "to yourselves, do it also from love to me! And in remembrance of\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra.\n",
      "LXXIX. THE DRUNKEN SONG.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Meanwhile one after another had gone out into the open air, and into\n",
      "the cool, thoughtful night; Zarathustra himself, however, led the\n",
      "ugliest man by the hand, that he might show him his night-world, and the\n",
      "great round moon, and the silvery water-falls near his cave. There they\n",
      "at last stood still beside one another; all of them old people, but with\n",
      "comforted, brave hearts, and astonished in themselves that it was so\n",
      "well with them on earth; the mystery of the night, however, came nigher\n",
      "and nigher to their hearts. And anew Zarathustra thought to himself:\n",
      "“Oh, how well do they now please me, these higher men!”—but he did not\n",
      "say it aloud, for he respected their happiness and their silence.—\n",
      "Then, however, there happened that which in this astonishing long day\n",
      "was most astonishing: the ugliest man began once more and for the last\n",
      "time to gurgle and snort, and when he had at length found expression,\n",
      "behold! there sprang a question plump and plain out of his mouth, a\n",
      "good, deep, clear question, which moved the hearts of all who listened\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "“My friends, all of you,” said the ugliest man, “what think ye? For\n",
      "the sake of this day—I am for the first time content to have\n",
      "lived mine entire life.\n",
      "And that I testify so much is still not enough for me. It is worth\n",
      "while living on the earth: one day, one festival with Zarathustra, hath\n",
      "taught me to love the earth.\n",
      "‘Was THAT—life?’ will I say unto death. ‘Well! Once more!’\n",
      "My friends, what think ye? Will ye not, like me, say unto death: ‘Was\n",
      "THAT—life? For the sake of Zarathustra, well! Once more!’”—\n",
      "Thus spake the ugliest man; it was not, however, far from midnight.\n",
      "And what took place then, think ye? As soon as the higher men heard his\n",
      "question, they became all at once conscious of their transformation and\n",
      "convalescence, and of him who was the cause thereof: then did they rush\n",
      "up to Zarathustra, thanking, honouring, caressing him, and kissing his\n",
      "hands, each in his own peculiar way; so that some laughed and some wept.\n",
      "The old soothsayer, however, danced with delight; and though he was\n",
      "then, as some narrators suppose, full of sweet wine, he was certainly\n",
      "still fuller of sweet life, and had renounced all weariness. There are\n",
      "even those who narrate that the ass then danced: for not in vain had the\n",
      "ugliest man previously given it wine to drink. That may be the case, or\n",
      "it may be otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening,\n",
      "there nevertheless happened then greater and rarer wonders than the\n",
      "dancing of an ass would have been. In short, as the proverb of\n",
      "Zarathustra saith: “What doth it matter!”\n",
      "2.\n",
      "When, however, this took place with the ugliest man, Zarathustra\n",
      "stood there like one drunken: his glance dulled, his tongue faltered and\n",
      "his feet staggered. And who could divine what thoughts then passed\n",
      "through Zarathustra’s soul? Apparently, however, his spirit retreated\n",
      "and fled in advance and was in remote distances, and as it were\n",
      "“wandering on high mountain-ridges,” as it standeth written, “‘twixt two\n",
      "seas,\n",
      "—Wandering ‘twixt the past and the future as a heavy cloud.”\n",
      "Gradually, however, while the higher men held him in their arms, he came\n",
      "back to himself a little, and resisted with his hands the crowd of the\n",
      "honouring and caring ones; but he did not speak. All at once, however,\n",
      "he turned his head quickly, for he seemed to hear something: then laid\n",
      "he his finger on his mouth and said: “COME!”\n",
      "And immediately it became still and mysterious round about; from the\n",
      "depth however there came up slowly the sound of a clock-bell.\n",
      "Zarathustra listened thereto, like the higher men; then, however, laid\n",
      "he his finger on his mouth the second time, and said again: “COME! COME!\n",
      "IT IS GETTING ON TO MIDNIGHT!”—and his voice had changed. But still he\n",
      "had not moved from the spot. Then it became yet stiller and more\n",

      "songs. The audient ear for ME—the OBEDIENT ear, is yet lacking in their\n",
      "limbs.”\n",
      "—This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun arose: then\n",
      "looked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above him the sharp call of\n",
      "his eagle. “Well!” called he upwards, “thus is it pleasing and proper to\n",
      "me. Mine animals are awake, for I am awake.\n",
      "Mine eagle is awake, and like me honoureth the sun. With eagle-talons\n",
      "doth it grasp at the new light. Ye are my proper animals; I love\n",
      "you.\n",
      "But still do I lack my proper men!”—\n",
      "Thus spake Zarathustra; then, however, it happened that all on a\n",
      "sudden he became aware that he was flocked around and fluttered around,\n",
      "as if by innumerable birds,—the whizzing of so many wings, however, and\n",
      "the crowding around his head was so great that he shut his eyes. And\n",
      "verily, there came down upon him as it were a cloud, like a cloud of\n",
      "arrows which poureth upon a new enemy. But behold, here it was a cloud\n",
      "of love, and showered upon a new friend.\n",
      "“What happeneth unto me?” thought Zarathustra in his astonished\n",
      "heart, and slowly seated himself on the big stone which lay close to the\n",
      "exit from his cave. But while he grasped about with his hands, around\n",
      "him, above him and below him, and repelled the tender birds, behold,\n",
      "there then happened to him something still stranger: for he grasped\n",
      "thereby unawares into a mass of thick, warm, shaggy hair; at the same\n",
      "time, however, there sounded before him a roar,—a long, soft\n",
      "lion-roar.\n",
      "“THE SIGN COMETH,” said Zarathustra, and a change came over his\n",
      "heart. And in truth, when it turned clear before him, there lay a\n",
      "yellow, powerful animal at his feet, resting its head on his\n",
      "knee,—unwilling to leave him out of love, and doing like a dog which\n",
      "again findeth its old master. The doves, however, were no less eager\n",
      "with their love than the lion; and whenever a dove whisked over its\n",
      "nose, the lion shook its head and wondered and laughed.\n",
      "When all this went on Zarathustra spake only a word: “MY CHILDREN ARE\n",
      "NIGH, MY CHILDREN”—, then he became quite mute. His heart, however, was\n",
      "loosed, and from his eyes there dropped down tears and fell upon his\n",
      "hands. And he took no further notice of anything, but sat there\n",
      "motionless, without repelling the animals further. Then flew the doves\n",
      "to and fro, and perched on his shoulder, and caressed his white hair,\n",
      "and did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness. The strong lion,\n",
      "however, licked always the tears that fell on Zarathustra’s hands, and\n",
      "roared and growled shyly. Thus did these animals do.—\n",
      "All this went on for a long time, or a short time: for properly\n",
      "speaking, there is NO time on earth for such things—. Meanwhile,\n",
      "however, the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra’s cave, and\n",
      "marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet Zarathustra, and\n",
      "give him their morning greeting: for they had found when they awakened\n",
      "that he no longer tarried with them. When, however, they reached the\n",
      "door of the cave and the noise of their steps had preceded them, the\n",
      "lion started violently; it turned away all at once from Zarathustra, and\n",
      "roaring wildly, sprang towards the cave. The higher men, however, when\n",
      "they heard the lion roaring, cried all aloud as with one voice, fled\n",
      "back and vanished in an instant.\n",
      "Zarathustra himself, however, stunned and strange, rose from his\n",
      "seat, looked around him, stood there astonished, inquired of his heart,\n",
      "bethought himself, and remained alone. “What did I hear?” said he at\n",
      "last, slowly, “what happened unto me just now?”\n",
      "But soon there came to him his recollection, and he took in at a\n",
      "glance all that had taken place between yesterday and to-day. “Here is\n",
      "indeed the stone,” said he, and stroked his beard, “on IT sat I\n",
      "yester-morn; and here came the soothsayer unto me, and here heard I\n",
      "first the cry which I heard just now, the great cry of distress.\n",
      "O ye higher men, YOUR distress was it that the old soothsayer\n",
      "foretold to me yester-morn,—\n",
      "—Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: ‘O\n",
      "Zarathustra,’ said he to me, ‘I come to seduce thee to thy last\n",
      "sin.’\n",
      "To my last sin?” cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at his own\n",
      "words: “WHAT hath been reserved for me as my last sin?”\n",
      "—And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, and sat down\n",
      "again on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly he sprang up,—\n",
      "“FELLOW-SUFFERING! FELLOW-SUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN!” he cried\n",
      "out, and his countenance changed into brass. “Well! THAT—hath had its\n",

      "My suffering and my fellow-suffering—what matter about them! Do I\n",
      "then strive after HAPPINESS? I strive after my WORK!\n",

      "grown ripe, mine hour hath come:—\n",
      "This is MY morning, MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE, THOU GREAT\n",
      "NOONTIDE!”—\n",

      "APPENDIX.\n",
      "NOTES ON “THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA” BY ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.\n",
      "I have had some opportunities of studying the conditions under which\n",
      "Nietzsche is read in Germany, France, and England, and I have found\n",
      "that, in each of these countries, students of his philosophy, as if\n",
      "actuated by precisely similar motives and desires, and misled by the\n",
      "same mistaken tactics on the part of most publishers, all proceed in the\n",
      "same happy-go-lucky style when “taking him up.” They have had it said to\n",
      "them that he wrote without any system, and they very naturally conclude\n",
      "that it does not matter in the least whether they begin with his first,\n",
      "third, or last book, provided they can obtain a few vague ideas as to\n",
      "what his leading and most sensational principles were.\n",
      "Now, it is clear that the book with the most mysterious, startling,\n",
      "or suggestive title, will always stand the best chance of being\n",
      "purchased by those who have no other criteria to guide them in their\n",
      "choice than the aspect of a title-page; and this explains why “Thus\n",
      "Spake Zarathustra” is almost always the first and often the only one of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s books that falls into the hands of the uninitiated.\n",
      "The title suggests all kinds of mysteries; a glance at the\n",
      "chapter-headings quickly confirms the suspicions already aroused, and\n",
      "the sub-title: “A Book for All and None”, generally succeeds in\n",
      "dissipating the last doubts the prospective purchaser may entertain\n",
      "concerning his fitness for the book or its fitness for him. And what\n",
      "happens?\n",
      "“Thus Spake Zarathustra” is taken home; the reader, who perchance may\n",
      "know no more concerning Nietzsche than a magazine article has told him,\n",
      "tries to read it and, understanding less than half he reads, probably\n",
      "never gets further than the second or third part,—and then only to feel\n",
      "convinced that Nietzsche himself was “rather hazy” as to what he was\n",
      "talking about. Such chapters as “The Child with the Mirror”, “In the\n",
      "Happy Isles”, “The Grave-Song,” “Immaculate Perception,” “The Stillest\n",
      "Hour”, “The Seven Seals”, and many others, are almost utterly devoid of\n",
      "meaning to all those who do not know something of Nietzsche’s life, his\n",
      "aims and his friendships.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, “Thus Spake Zarathustra”, though it is\n",
      "unquestionably Nietzsche’s opus magnum, is by no means the first of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s works that the beginner ought to undertake to read. The\n",
      "author himself refers to it as the deepest work ever offered to the\n",
      "German public, and elsewhere speaks of his other writings as being\n",
      "necessary for the understanding of it. But when it is remembered that in\n",
      "Zarathustra we not only have the history of his most intimate\n",
      "experiences, friendships, feuds, disappointments, triumphs and the like,\n",
      "but that the very form in which they are narrated is one which tends\n",
      "rather to obscure than to throw light upon them, the difficulties which\n",
      "meet the reader who starts quite unprepared will be seen to be really\n",
      "formidable.\n",
      "Zarathustra, then,—this shadowy, allegorical personality, speaking in\n",
      "allegories and parables, and at times not even refraining from relating\n",
      "his own dreams—is a figure we can understand but very imperfectly if we\n",
      "have no knowledge of his creator and counterpart, Friedrich Nietzsche;\n",
      "and it were therefore well, previous to our study of the more abstruse\n",
      "parts of this book, if we were to turn to some authoritative book on\n",
      "Nietzsche’s life and works and to read all that is there said on the\n",
      "subject. Those who can read German will find an excellent guide, in this\n",
      "respect, in Frau Foerster-Nietzsche’s exhaustive and highly interesting\n",
      "biography of her brother: “Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsche’s” (published\n",
      "by Naumann); while the works of Deussen, Raoul Richter, and Baroness\n",
      "Isabelle von Unger-Sternberg, will be found to throw useful and\n",
      "necessary light upon many questions which it would be difficult for a\n",
      "sister to touch upon.\n",
      "In regard to the actual philosophical views expounded in this work,\n",
      "there is an excellent way of clearing up any difficulties they may\n",
      "present, and that is by an appeal to Nietzsche’s other works. Again and\n",
      "again, of course, he will be found to express himself so clearly that\n",
      "all reference to his other writings may be dispensed with; but where\n",
      "this is not the case, the advice he himself gives is after all the best\n",
      "to be followed here, viz.:—to regard such works as: “Joyful Science”,\n",
      "“Beyond Good and Evil”, “The Genealogy of Morals”, “The Twilight of the\n",
      "Idols”, “The Antichrist”, “The Will to Power”, etc., etc., as the\n",
      "necessary preparation for “Thus Spake Zarathustra”.\n",
      "These directions, though they are by no means simple to carry out,\n",
      "seem at least to possess the quality of definiteness and\n",
      "straightforwardness. “Follow them and all will be clear,” I seem to\n",
      "imply. But I regret to say that this is not really the case. For my\n",
      "experience tells me that even after the above directions have been\n",
      "followed with the greatest possible zeal, the student will still halt in\n",
      "perplexity before certain passages in the book before us, and wonder\n",
      "what they mean. Now, it is with the view of giving a little additional\n",
      "help to all those who find themselves in this position that I proceed to\n",
      "put forth my own personal interpretation of the more abstruse passages\n",
      "in this work.\n",
      "In offering this little commentary to the Nietzsche student, I should\n",
      "like it to be understood that I make no claim as to its infallibility or\n",
      "indispensability. It represents but an attempt on my part—a very feeble\n",
      "one perhaps—to give the reader what little help I can in surmounting\n",
      "difficulties which a long study of Nietzsche’s life and works has\n",
      "enabled me, partially I hope, to overcome.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Perhaps it would be as well to start out with a broad and rapid\n",
      "sketch of Nietzsche as a writer on Morals, Evolution, and Sociology, so\n",
      "that the reader may be prepared to pick out for himself, so to speak,\n",
      "all passages in this work bearing in any way upon Nietzsche’s views in\n",
      "those three important branches of knowledge.\n",
      "(A.) Nietzsche and Morality.\n",
      "In morality, Nietzsche starts out by adopting the position of the\n",
      "relativist. He says there are no absolute values “good” and “evil”;\n",
      "these are mere means adopted by all in order to acquire power to\n",
      "maintain their place in the world, or to become supreme. It is the\n",
      "lion’s good to devour an antelope. It is the dead-leaf butterfly’s good\n",
      "to tell a foe a falsehood. For when the dead-leaf butterfly is in\n",
      "danger, it clings to the side of a twig, and what it says to its foe is\n",
      "practically this: “I am not a butterfly, I am a dead leaf, and can be of\n",
      "no use to thee.” This is a lie which is good to the butterfly, for it\n",
      "preserves it. In nature every species of organic being instinctively\n",
      "adopts and practises those acts which most conduce to the prevalence or\n",
      "supremacy of its kind. Once the most favourable order of conduct is\n",
      "found, proved efficient and established, it becomes the ruling morality\n",
      "of the species that adopts it and bears them along to victory. All\n",
      "species must not and cannot value alike, for what is the lion’s good is\n",
      "the antelope’s evil and vice versa.\n",
      "Concepts of good and evil are therefore, in their origin, merely a\n",
      "means to an end, they are expedients for acquiring power.\n",
      "Applying this principle to mankind, Nietzsche attacked Christian\n",
      "moral values. He declared them to be, like all other morals, merely an\n",
      "expedient for protecting a certain type of man. In the case of\n",
      "Christianity this type was, according to Nietzsche, a low one.\n",
      "Conflicting moral codes have been no more than the conflicting\n",
      "weapons of different classes of men; for in mankind there is a continual\n",
      "war between the powerful, the noble, the strong, and the\n",
      "well-constituted on the one side, and the impotent, the mean, the weak,\n",
      "and the ill-constituted on the other. The war is a war of moral\n",
      "principles. The morality of the powerful class, Nietzsche calls NOBLE-\n",
      "or MASTER-MORALITY; that of the weak and subordinate class he calls\n",
      "SLAVE-MORALITY. In the first morality it is the eagle which, looking\n",
      "down upon a browsing lamb, contends that “eating lamb is good.” In the\n",
      "second, the slave-morality, it is the lamb which, looking up from the\n",
      "sward, bleats dissentingly: “Eating lamb is evil.”\n",
      "(B.) The Master- and Slave-Morality Compared.\n",
      "The first morality is active, creative, Dionysian. The second is\n",
      "passive, defensive,—to it belongs the “struggle for existence.”\n",
      "Where attempts have not been made to reconcile the two moralities,\n",
      "they may be described as follows:—All is GOOD in the noble morality\n",
      "which proceeds from strength, power, health, well-constitutedness,\n",
      "happiness, and awfulness; for, the motive force behind the people\n",
      "practising it is “the struggle for power.” The antithesis “good and bad”\n",
      "to this first class means the same as “noble” and “despicable.” “Bad” in\n",
      "the master-morality must be applied to the coward, to all acts that\n",
      "spring from weakness, to the man with “an eye to the main chance,” who\n",
      "would forsake everything in order to live.\n",
      "With the second, the slave-morality, the case is different. There,\n",
      "inasmuch as the community is an oppressed, suffering, unemancipated, and\n",
      "weary one, all THAT will be held to be good which alleviates the state\n",
      "of suffering. Pity, the obliging hand, the warm heart, patience,\n",
      "industry, and humility—these are unquestionably the qualities we shall\n",
      "here find flooded with the light of approval and admiration; because\n",
      "they are the most USEFUL qualities—; they make life endurable, they are\n",
      "of assistance in the “struggle for existence” which is the motive force\n",
      "behind the people practising this morality. To this class, all that is\n",
      "AWFUL is bad, in fact it is THE evil par excellence. Strength, health,\n",
      "superabundance of animal spirits and power, are regarded with hate,\n",
      "suspicion, and fear by the subordinate class.\n",
      "Now Nietzsche believed that the first or the noble-morality conduced\n",
      "to an ascent in the line of life; because it was creative and active. On\n",
      "the other hand, he believed that the second or slave-morality, where it\n",
      "became paramount, led to degeneration, because it was passive and\n",
      "defensive, wanting merely to keep those who practised it alive. Hence\n",
      "his earnest advocacy of noble-morality.\n",
      "(C.) Nietzsche and Evolution.\n",
      "Nietzsche as an evolutionist I shall have occasion to define and\n",
      "discuss in the course of these notes (see Notes on Chapter LVI., par.10,\n",
      "and on Chapter LVII.). For the present let it suffice for us to know\n",
      "that he accepted the “Development Hypothesis” as an explanation of the\n",
      "origin of species: but he did not halt where most naturalists have\n",
      "halted. He by no means regarded man as the highest possible being which\n",
      "evolution could arrive at; for though his physical development may have\n",
      "reached its limit, this is not the case with his mental or spiritual\n",
      "attributes. If the process be a fact; if things have BECOME what they\n",
      "are, then, he contends, we may describe no limit to man’s aspirations.\n",
      "If he struggled up from barbarism, and still more remotely from the\n",
      "lower Primates, his ideal should be to surpass man himself and reach\n",
      "Superman (see especially the Prologue).\n",
      "(D.) Nietzsche and Sociology.\n",
      "Nietzsche as a sociologist aims at an aristocratic arrangement of\n",
      "society. He would have us rear an ideal race. Honest and truthful in\n",
      "intellectual matters, he could not even think that men are equal. “With\n",
      "these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded. For\n",
      "thus speaketh justice unto ME: ‘Men are not equal.’” He sees precisely\n",
      "in this inequality a purpose to be served, a condition to be exploited.\n",
      "“Every elevation of the type ‘man,’” he writes in “Beyond Good and\n",
      "Evil”, “has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society—and so\n",
      "will it always be—a society believing in a long scale of gradations of\n",
      "rank and differences of worth among human beings.”\n",
      "Those who are sufficiently interested to desire to read his own\n",
      "detailed account of the society he would fain establish, will find an\n",
      "excellent passage in Aphorism 57 of “The Antichrist”.\n",
      "...\n",
      "PART I. THE PROLOGUE.\n",
      "In Part I. including the Prologue, no very great difficulties will\n",
      "appear. Zarathustra’s habit of designating a whole class of men or a\n",
      "whole school of thought by a single fitting nickname may perhaps lead to\n",
      "a little confusion at first; but, as a rule, when the general drift of\n",
      "his arguments is grasped, it requires but a slight effort of the\n",
      "imagination to discover whom he is referring to. In the ninth paragraph\n",
      "of the Prologue, for instance, it is quite obvious that “Herdsmen” in\n",
      "the verse “Herdsmen, I say, etc., etc.,” stands for all those to-day who\n",
      "are the advocates of gregariousness—of the ant-hill. And when our author\n",
      "says: “A robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen,” it is\n",
      "clear that these words may be taken almost literally from one whose\n",
      "ideal was the rearing of a higher aristocracy. Again, “the good and\n",
      "just,” throughout the book, is the expression used in referring to the\n",
      "self-righteous of modern times,—those who are quite sure that they know\n",
      "all that is to be known concerning good and evil, and are satisfied that\n",
      "the values their little world of tradition has handed down to them, are\n",
      "destined to rule mankind as long as it lasts.\n",
      "In the last paragraph of the Prologue, verse 7, Zarathustra gives us\n",
      "a foretaste of his teaching concerning the big and the little\n",
      "sagacities, expounded subsequently. He says he would he were as wise as\n",
      "his serpent; this desire will be found explained in the discourse\n",
      "entitled “The Despisers of the Body”, which I shall have occasion to\n",
      "refer to later.\n",
      "... THE DISCOURSES.\n",
      "Chapter I. The Three Metamorphoses.\n",
      "This opening discourse is a parable in which Zarathustra discloses\n",
      "the mental development of all creators of new values. It is the story of\n",
      "a life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second\n",
      "ingenuousness or in returning to childhood. Nietzsche, the supposed\n",
      "anarchist, here plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy,\n",
      "for he shows us that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and\n",
      "submitting to it patiently, as the camel submits to being laden, does\n",
      "the free spirit acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him\n",
      "to meet and master the dragon “Thou shalt,”—the dragon with the values\n",
      "of a thousand years glittering on its scales. There are two lessons in\n",
      "this discourse: first, that in order to create one must be as a little\n",
      "child; secondly, that it is only through existing law and order that one\n",
      "attains to that height from which new law and new order may be\n",
      "promulgated.\n",
      "Chapter II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue.\n",
      "Almost the whole of this is quite comprehensible. It is a discourse\n",
      "against all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease, and\n",
      "who regard as virtuous only that which promotes security and tends to\n",
      "deepen sleep.\n",
      "Chapter IV. The Despisers of the Body.\n",
      "Here Zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts; he\n",
      "calls the one “the little sagacity” and the latter “the big sagacity.”\n",
      "Schopenhauer’s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here.\n",
      "“An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother,\n",
      "which thou callest ‘spirit,’” says Zarathustra. From beginning to end it\n",
      "is a warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts and\n",
      "unduly exalt the intellect and its derivatives: Reason and\n",
      "Understanding.\n",
      "Chapter IX. The Preachers of Death.\n",
      "This is an analysis of the psychology of all those who have the “evil\n",
      "eye” and are pessimists by virtue of their constitutions.\n",
      "Chapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.\n",
      "In this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of\n",
      "relativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means to\n",
      "power. Needless to say that verses 9, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the\n",
      "Greeks, the Persians, the Jews, and the Germans respectively. In the\n",
      "penultimate verse he makes known his discovery concerning the root of\n",
      "modern Nihilism and indifference,—i.e., that modern man has no goal, no\n",
      "aim, no ideals (see Note A).\n",
      "Chapter XVIII. Old and Young Women.\n",
      "Nietzsche’s views on women have either to be loved at first sight or\n",
      "they become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who\n",
      "otherwise would be inclined to accept his philosophy. Women especially,\n",
      "of course, have been taught to dislike them, because it has been\n",
      "rumoured that his views are unfriendly to themselves. Now, to my mind,\n",
      "all this is pure misunderstanding and error.\n",
      "German philosophers, thanks to Schopenhauer, have earned rather a bad\n",
      "name for their views on women. It is almost impossible for one of them\n",
      "to write a line on the subject, however kindly he may do so, without\n",
      "being suspected of wishing to open a crusade against the fair sex.\n",
      "Despite the fact, therefore, that all Nietzsche’s views in this respect\n",
      "were dictated to him by the profoundest love; despite Zarathustra’s\n",
      "reservation in this discourse, that “with women nothing (that can be\n",
      "said) is impossible,” and in the face of other overwhelming evidence to\n",
      "the contrary, Nietzsche is universally reported to have mis son pied\n",
      "dans le plat, where the female sex is concerned. And what is the\n",
      "fundamental doctrine which has given rise to so much bitterness and\n",
      "aversion?—Merely this: that the sexes are at bottom ANTAGONISTIC—that is\n",
      "to say, as different as blue is from yellow, and that the best possible\n",
      "means of rearing anything approaching a desirable race is to preserve\n",
      "and to foster this profound hostility. What Nietzsche strives to combat\n",
      "and to overthrow is the modern democratic tendency which is slowly\n",
      "labouring to level all things—even the sexes. His quarrel is not with\n",
      "women—what indeed could be more undignified?—it is with those who would\n",
      "destroy the natural relationship between the sexes, by modifying either\n",
      "the one or the other with a view to making them more alike. The human\n",
      "world is just as dependent upon women’s powers as upon men’s. It is\n",
      "women’s strongest and most valuable instincts which help to determine\n",
      "who are to be the fathers of the next generation. By destroying these\n",
      "particular instincts, that is to say by attempting to masculinise woman,\n",
      "and to feminise men, we jeopardise the future of our people. The general\n",
      "democratic movement of modern times, in its frantic struggle to mitigate\n",
      "all differences, is now invading even the world of sex. It is against\n",
      "this movement that Nietzsche raises his voice; he would have woman\n",
      "become ever more woman and man become ever more man. Only thus, and he\n",
      "is undoubtedly right, can their combined instincts lead to the\n",
      "excellence of humanity. Regarded in this light, all his views on woman\n",
      "appear not only necessary but just (see Note on Chapter LVI., par.\n",
      "21.)\n",
      "It is interesting to observe that the last line of the discourse,\n",
      "which has so frequently been used by women as a weapon against\n",
      "Nietzsche’s views concerning them, was suggested to Nietzsche by a woman\n",
      "(see “Das Leben F. Nietzsche’s”).\n",
      "Chapter XXI. Voluntary Death.\n",
      "In regard to this discourse, I should only like to point out that\n",
      "Nietzsche had a particular aversion to the word “suicide”—self-murder.\n",
      "He disliked the evil it suggested, and in rechristening the act\n",
      "Voluntary Death, i.e., the death that comes from no other hand than\n",
      "one’s own, he was desirous of elevating it to the position it held in\n",
      "classical antiquity (see Aphorism 36 in “The Twilight of the\n",
      "Idols”).\n",
      "Chapter XXII. The Bestowing Virtue.\n",
      "An important aspect of Nietzsche’s philosophy is brought to light in\n",
      "this discourse. His teaching, as is well known, places the Aristotelian\n",
      "man of spirit, above all others in the natural divisions of man. The man\n",
      "with overflowing strength, both of mind and body, who must discharge\n",
      "this strength or perish, is the Nietzschean ideal. To such a man, giving\n",
      "from his overflow becomes a necessity; bestowing develops into a means\n",
      "of existence, and this is the only giving, the only charity, that\n",
      "Nietzsche recognises. In paragraph 3 of the discourse, we read\n",
      "Zarathustra’s healthy exhortation to his disciples to become independent\n",
      "thinkers and to find themselves before they learn any more from him (see\n",
      "Notes on Chapters LVI., par. 5, and LXXIII., pars. 10, 11).\n",
      "...\n",
      "PART II.\n",
      "Chapter XXIII. The Child with the Mirror.\n",
      "Nietzsche tells us here, in a poetical form, how deeply grieved he\n",
      "was by the manifold misinterpretations and misunderstandings which were\n",
      "becoming rife concerning his publications. He does not recognise himself\n",
      "in the mirror of public opinion, and recoils terrified from the\n",
      "distorted reflection of his features. In verse 20 he gives us a hint\n",
      "which it were well not to pass over too lightly; for, in the\n",
      "introduction to “The Genealogy of Morals” (written in 1887) he finds it\n",
      "necessary to refer to the matter again and with greater precision. The\n",
      "point is this, that a creator of new values meets with his surest and\n",
      "strongest obstacles in the very spirit of the language which is at his\n",
      "disposal. Words, like all other manifestations of an evolving race, are\n",
      "stamped with the values that have long been paramount in that race. Now,\n",
      "the original thinker who finds himself compelled to use the current\n",
      "speech of his country in order to impart new and hitherto untried views\n",
      "to his fellows, imposes a task upon the natural means of communication\n",
      "which it is totally unfitted to perform,—hence the obscurities and\n",
      "prolixities which are so frequently met with in the writings of original\n",
      "thinkers. In the “Dawn of Day”, Nietzsche actually cautions young\n",
      "writers against THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BY\n",
      "THE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.\n",
      "Chapter XXIV. In the Happy Isles.\n",
      "While writing this, Nietzsche is supposed to have been thinking of\n",
      "the island of Ischia which was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake.\n",
      "His teaching here is quite clear. He was among the first thinkers of\n",
      "Europe to overcome the pessimism which godlessness generally brings in\n",
      "its wake. He points to creating as the surest salvation from the\n",
      "suffering which is a concomitant of all higher life. “What would there\n",
      "be to create,” he asks, “if there were—Gods?” His ideal, the Superman,\n",
      "lends him the cheerfulness necessary to the overcoming of that despair\n",
      "usually attendant upon godlessness and upon the apparent aimlessness of\n",
      "a world without a god.\n",
      "Chapter XXIX. The Tarantulas.\n",
      "The tarantulas are the Socialists and Democrats. This discourse\n",
      "offers us an analysis of their mental attitude. Nietzsche refuses to be\n",
      "confounded with those resentful and revengeful ones who condemn society\n",
      "FROM BELOW, and whose criticism is only suppressed envy. “There are\n",
      "those who preach my doctrine of life,” he says of the Nietzschean\n",
      "Socialists, “and are at the same time preachers of equality and\n",
      "tarantulas” (see Notes on Chapter XL. and Chapter LI.).\n",
      "Chapter XXX. The Famous Wise Ones.\n",
      "This refers to all those philosophers hitherto, who have run in the\n",
      "harness of established values and have not risked their reputation with\n",
      "the people in pursuit of truth. The philosopher, however, as Nietzsche\n",
      "understood him, is a man who creates new values, and thus leads mankind\n",
      "in a new direction.\n",
      "Chapter XXXIII. The Grave-Song.\n",
      "Here Zarathustra sings about the ideals and friendships of his youth.\n",
      "Verses 27 to 31 undoubtedly refer to Richard Wagner (see Note on Chapter\n",
      "LXV.).\n",
      "Chapter XXXIV. Self-Surpassing.\n",
      "In this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s doctrine of the Will to Power. I go into this question\n",
      "thoroughly in the Note on Chapter LVII.\n",
      "Nietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice. Those who hastily class\n",
      "him with the anarchists (or the Progressivists of the last century) fail\n",
      "to understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and\n",
      "discipline. In verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly\n",
      "explains his position when he says: “...he who hath to be a creator in\n",
      "good and evil—verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values\n",
      "in pieces.” This teaching in regard to self-control is evidence enough\n",
      "of his reverence for law.\n",
      "Chapter XXXV. The Sublime Ones.\n",
      "These belong to a type which Nietzsche did not altogether dislike,\n",
      "but which he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic. It is the\n",
      "type that takes life and itself too seriously, that never surmounts the\n",
      "camel-stage mentioned in the first discourse, and that is obdurately\n",
      "sublime and earnest. To be able to smile while speaking of lofty things\n",
      "and NOT TO BE OPPRESSED by them, is the secret of real greatness. He\n",
      "whose hand trembles when it lays hold of a beautiful thing, has the\n",
      "quality of reverence, without the artist’s unembarrassed friendship with\n",
      "the beautiful. Hence the mistakes which have arisen in regard to\n",
      "confounding Nietzsche with his extreme opposites the anarchists and\n",
      "agitators. For what they dare to touch and break with the impudence and\n",
      "irreverence of the unappreciative, he seems likewise to touch and\n",
      "break,—but with other fingers—with the fingers of the loving and\n",
      "unembarrassed artist who is on good terms with the beautiful and who\n",
      "feels able to create it and to enhance it with his touch. The question\n",
      "of taste plays an important part in Nietzsche’s philosophy, and verses\n",
      "9, 10 of this discourse exactly state Nietzsche’s ultimate views on the\n",
      "subject. In the “Spirit of Gravity”, he actually cries:—“Neither a good\n",
      "nor a bad taste, but MY taste, of which I have no longer either shame or\n",

      "verse 19 we are told what Nietzsche called Redemption—that is to say,\n",
      "the ability to say of all that is past: “Thus would I have it.” The in\n",
      "ability to say this, and the resentment which results therefrom, he\n",

      "amongst men, must learn to drink out of all glasses: and he who would\n",
      "keep clean amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty\n",

      "when individuality is supposed to be shown most tellingly by putting\n",
      "boots on one’s hands and gloves on one’s feet, it is somewhat refreshing\n",
      "to come across a true individualist who feels the chasm between himself\n",
      "and others so deeply, that he must perforce adapt himself to them\n",
      "outwardly, at least, in all respects, so that the inner difference\n",
      "should be overlooked. Nietzsche practically tells us here that it is not\n",
      "he who intentionally wears eccentric clothes or does eccentric things\n",
      "who is truly the individualist. The profound man, who is by nature\n",
      "differentiated from his fellows, feels this difference too keenly to\n",

      "This is perhaps the most important of all the four parts. If it\n",
      "contained only “The Vision and the Enigma” and “The Old and New Tables”\n",
      "I should still be of this opinion; for in the former of these discourses\n",

      "Chapter XLVI. The Vision and the Enigma.\n",
      "“The Vision and the Enigma” is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his\n",

      "the oppressing and depressing influence of man’s sense of guilt and\n",
      "consciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this\n",
      "discourse. Slowly but surely, he thought the values of Christianity and\n",

      "once but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of\n",
      "humanity, had now passed into man’s blood and had become instincts. This\n",
      "oppressive and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what Nietzsche\n",
      "refers to when he speaks of “the spirit of gravity.” This creature\n",
      "half-dwarf, half-mole, whom he bears with him a certain distance on his\n",
      "climb and finally defies, and whom he calls his devil and arch-enemy, is\n",
      "nothing more than the heavy millstone “guilty conscience,” together with\n",
      "the concept of sin which at present hangs round the neck of men. To rise\n",
      "above it—to soar—is the most difficult of all things to-day. Nietzsche\n",
      "is able to think cheerfully and optimistically of the possibility of\n",
      "life in this world recurring again and again, when he has once cast the\n",
      "dwarf from his shoulders, and he announces his doctrine of the Eternal\n",
      "Recurrence of all things great and small to his arch-enemy and in\n",
      "defiance of him.\n",

      "Eternal Recurrence of all things great and small, nobody who has read\n",
      "the literature on the subject will doubt for an instant; but it remains\n",
      "a very daring conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate\n",
      "effect, as a dogma, on the minds of men, I venture to doubt whether\n",
      "Nietzsche ever properly estimated its worth (see Note on Chapter\n",
      "LVII.).\n",
      "What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra sees a young shepherd\n",
      "struggling on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his\n",
      "throat. The sage, assuming that the snake must have crawled into the\n",
      "young man’s mouth while he lay sleeping, runs to his help and pulls at\n",
      "the loathsome reptile with all his might, but in vain. At last, in\n",
      "despair, Zarathustra appeals to the young man’s will. Knowing full well\n",
      "what a ghastly operation he is recommending, he nevertheless cries,\n",
      "“Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!” as the only possible solution of the\n",
      "difficulty. The young shepherd bites, and far away he spits the snake’s\n",
      "head, whereupon he rises, “No longer shepherd, no longer man—a\n",
      "transfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that LAUGHED! Never on\n",
      "earth laughed a man as he laughed!”\n",
      "In this parable the young shepherd is obviously the man of to-day;\n",
      "the snake that chokes him represents the stultifying and paralysing\n",
      "social values that threaten to shatter humanity, and the advice “Bite!\n",
      "Bite!” is but Nietzsche’s exasperated cry to mankind to alter their\n",

      "Chapter XLVII. Involuntary Bliss.\n",
      "This, like “The Wanderer”, is one of the many introspective passages\n",

      "Those who are familiar with Nietzsche’s philosophy will not require to\n",

      "Chapter XLIX. The Bedwarfing Virtue.\n",
      "This requires scarcely any comment. It is a satire on modern man and\n",

      "discourse we are reminded of Nietzsche’s powerful indictment of the\n",

      "makes revolutions and WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE them, it is Christianity,\n",
      "let us not doubt it, it is CHRISTIAN valuations, which translate every\n",
      "revolution merely into blood and crime!” (see also “Beyond Good and\n",
      "Evil”, pages 120, 121). Nietzsche thought it was a bad sign of the times\n",
      "that even rulers have lost the courage of their positions, and that a\n",
      "man of Frederick the Great’s power and distinguished gifts should have\n",
      "been able to say: “Ich bin der erste Diener des Staates” (I am the first\n",
      "servant of the State.) To this utterance of the great sovereign, verse\n",
      "24 undoubtedly refers. “Cowardice” and “Mediocrity,” are the names with\n",
      "which he labels modern notions of virtue and moderation.\n",
      "In Part III., we get the sentiments of the discourse “In the Happy\n",
      "Isles”, but perhaps in stronger terms. Once again we find Nietzsche\n",
      "thoroughly at ease, if not cheerful, as an atheist, and speaking with\n",
      "vertiginous daring of making chance go on its knees to him. In verse 20,\n",
      "Zarathustra makes yet another attempt at defining his entirely\n",

      "laying anarchy at his door, it is impossible to understand how he ever\n",
      "became associated with that foul political party.\n",
      "The last verse introduces the expression, “THE GREAT NOONTIDE!” In\n",
      "the poem to be found at the end of “Beyond Good and Evil”, we meet with\n",
      "the expression again, and we shall find it occurring time and again in\n",
      "Nietzsche’s works. It will be found fully elucidated in the fifth part\n",
      "of “The Twilight of the Idols”; but for those who cannot refer to this\n",

      "whose hands his philosophy has suffered most since his death. In this\n",

      "prone to confound the two, to the detriment of the nobler type.\n",
      "If we now read what the fool says to Zarathustra, and note the tricks\n",

      "he assumes, we shall understand why Zarathustra finally interrupts him.\n",

      "lightly by those whom poetasters have made distrustful of poetry. From\n",
      "first to last it is extremely valuable as an autobiographical note. The\n",
      "inevitable superficiality of the rabble is contrasted with the peaceful\n",

      "new values and scathing criticism of existing values. In verse 30 we are\n",
      "told that pity was his greatest danger. The broad altruism of the\n",
      "law-giver, thinking over vast eras of time, was continually being pitted\n",
      "by Nietzsche, in himself, against that transient and meaner sympathy for\n",
      "the neighbour which he more perhaps than any of his contemporaries had\n",
      "suffered from, but which he was certain involved enormous dangers not\n",
      "only for himself but also to the next and subsequent generations (see\n",
      "Note B., where “pity” is mentioned among the degenerate virtues). Later\n",
      "in the book we shall see how his profound compassion leads him into\n",
      "temptation, and how frantically he struggles against it. In verses 31\n",
      "and 32, he tells us to what extent he had to modify himself in order to\n",
      "be endured by his fellows whom he loved (see also verse 12 in “Manly\n",
      "Prudence”). Nietzsche’s great love for his fellows, which he confesses\n",
      "in the Prologue, and which is at the root of all his teaching, seems\n",
      "rather to elude the discerning powers of the average philanthropist and\n",
      "modern man. He cannot see the wood for the trees. A philanthropy that\n",
      "sacrifices the minority of the present-day for the majority constituting\n",
      "posterity, completely evades his mental grasp, and Nietzsche’s\n",
      "philosophy, because it declares Christian values to be a danger to the\n",
      "future of our kind, is therefore shelved as brutal, cold, and hard (see\n",
      "Note on Chapter XXXVI.). Nietzsche tried to be all things to all men; he\n",

      "from the effects of his experiment.\n",
      "Chapter LIV. The Three Evil Things.\n",
      "Nietzsche is here completely in his element. Three things hitherto\n",
      "best cursed and most calumniated on earth, are brought forward to be\n",
      "weighed. Voluptuousness, thirst of power, and selfishness,—the three\n",
      "forces in humanity which Christianity has done most to garble and\n",
      "besmirch,—Nietzsche endeavours to reinstate in their former places of\n",
      "honour. Voluptuousness, or sensual pleasure, is a dangerous thing to\n",
      "discuss nowadays. If we mention it with favour we may be regarded,\n",
      "however unjustly, as the advocate of savages, satyrs, and pure\n",
      "sensuality. If we condemn it, we either go over to the Puritans or we\n",
      "join those who are wont to come to table with no edge to their appetites\n",
      "and who therefore grumble at all good fare. There can be no doubt that\n",
      "the value of healthy innocent voluptuousness, like the value of health\n",
      "itself, must have been greatly discounted by all those who, resenting\n",
      "their inability to partake of this world’s goods, cried like St Paul: “I\n",
      "would that all men were even as I myself.” Now Nietzsche’s philosophy\n",
      "might be called an attempt at giving back to healthy and normal men\n",
      "innocence and a clean conscience in their desires—NOT to applaud the\n",
      "vulgar sensualists who respond to every stimulus and whose passions are\n",
      "out of hand; not to tell the mean, selfish individual, whose selfishness\n",
      "is a pollution (see Aphorism 33, “Twilight of the Idols”), that he is\n",
      "right, nor to assure the weak, the sick, and the crippled, that the\n",
      "thirst of power, which they gratify by exploiting the happier and\n",
      "healthier individuals, is justified;—but to save the clean healthy man\n",

      "obscurity (see also verses 3 to 7 of “Poets”). As I have already pointed\n",

      "So far, this is perhaps the most important paragraph. It is a protest\n",
      "against reading a moral order of things in life. “Life is something\n",

      "further as “the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external\n",

      "Note on Chapter XVIII.) running all through Nietzsche’s writings. But\n",
      "sharp differentiation also implies antagonism in some form or\n",

      "above all, is peace and the cessation of pain. But neither great races\n",
      "nor great castes have ever been built up in this way. “Who still wanteth\n",

      "these things meant to the millions who profess them, to approach the\n",
      "task of uprooting them with levity or even with haste. He saw what\n",
      "modern anarchists and revolutionists do NOT see—namely, that man is in\n",
      "danger of actual destruction when his customs and values are broken. I\n",
      "need hardly point out, therefore, how deeply he was conscious of the\n",

      "of his earnestness.\n",
      "Chapter LVII. The Convalescent.\n",
      "We meet with several puzzles here. Zarathustra calls himself the\n",
      "advocate of the circle (the Eternal Recurrence of all things), and he\n",
      "calls this doctrine his abysmal thought. In the last verse of the first\n",
      "paragraph, however, after hailing his deepest thought, he cries:\n",
      "“Disgust, disgust, disgust!” We know Nietzsche’s ideal man was that\n",
      "“world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious creature, who has not only\n",
      "learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes\n",
      "to have it again, AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity insatiably calling\n",
      "out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play” (see\n",
      "Note on Chapter XLII.). But if one ask oneself what the conditions to\n",
      "such an attitude are, one will realise immediately how utterly different\n",
      "Nietzsche was from his ideal. The man who insatiably cries da capo to\n",
      "himself and to the whole of his mise-en-scene, must be in a position to\n",
      "desire every incident in his life to be repeated, not once, but again\n",
      "and again eternally. Now, Nietzsche’s life had been too full of\n",
      "disappointments, illness, unsuccessful struggles, and snubs, to allow of\n",
      "his thinking of the Eternal Recurrence without loathing—hence probably\n",
      "the words of the last verse.\n",
      "In verses 15 and 16, we have Nietzsche declaring himself an\n",
      "evolutionist in the broadest sense—that is to say, that he believes in\n",
      "the Development Hypothesis as the description of the process by which\n",
      "species have originated. Now, to understand his position correctly we\n",
      "must show his relationship to the two greatest of modern\n",
      "evolutionists—Darwin and Spencer. As a philosopher, however, Nietzsche\n",
      "does not stand or fall by his objections to the Darwinian or Spencerian\n",
      "cosmogony. He never laid claim to a very profound knowledge of biology,\n",
      "and his criticism is far more valuable as the attitude of a fresh mind\n",
      "than as that of a specialist towards the question. Moreover, in his\n",
      "objections many difficulties are raised which are not settled by an\n",
      "appeal to either of the men above mentioned. We have given Nietzsche’s\n",
      "definition of life in the Note on Chapter LVI., par. 10. Still, there\n",
      "remains a hope that Darwin and Nietzsche may some day become reconciled\n",
      "by a new description of the processes by which varieties occur. The\n",
      "appearance of varieties among animals and of “sporting plants” in the\n",
      "vegetable kingdom, is still shrouded in mystery, and the question\n",
      "whether this is not precisely the ground on which Darwin and Nietzsche\n",
      "will meet, is an interesting one. The former says in his “Origin of\n",
      "Species”, concerning the causes of variability: “...there are two\n",
      "factors, namely, the nature of the organism, and the nature of the\n",
      "conditions. THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT (The italics\n",
      "are mine.), for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far\n",
      "as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and on the other hand,\n",
      "dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly\n",
      "uniform.” Nietzsche, recognising this same truth, would ascribe\n",
      "practically all the importance to the “highest functionaries in the\n",
      "organism, in which the life-will appears as an active and formative\n",
      "principle,” and except in certain cases (where passive organisms alone\n",
      "are concerned) would not give such a prominent place to the influence of\n",
      "environment. Adaptation, according to him, is merely a secondary\n",
      "activity, a mere re-activity, and he is therefore quite opposed to\n",
      "Spencer’s definition: “Life is the continuous adjustment of internal\n",
      "relations to external relations.” Again in the motive force behind\n",
      "animal and plant life, Nietzsche disagrees with Darwin. He transforms\n",
      "the “Struggle for Existence”—the passive and involuntary condition—into\n",
      "the “Struggle for Power,” which is active and creative, and much more in\n",
      "harmony with Darwin’s own view, given above, concerning the importance\n",
      "of the organism itself. The change is one of such far-reaching\n",
      "importance that we cannot dispose of it in a breath, as a mere play upon\n",
      "words. “Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one.”\n",
      "Nietzsche says that to speak of the activity of life as a “struggle for\n",
      "existence,” is to state the case inadequately. He warns us not to\n",
      "confound Malthus with nature. There is something more than this struggle\n",
      "between the organic beings on this earth; want, which is supposed to\n",
      "bring this struggle about, is not so common as is supposed; some other\n",
      "force must be operative. The Will to Power is this force, “the instinct\n",
      "of self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent\n",
      "results thereof.” A certain lack of acumen in psychological questions\n",
      "and the condition of affairs in England at the time Darwin wrote, may\n",
      "both, according to Nietzsche, have induced the renowned naturalist to\n",

      "meet with a doctrine which, at first sight, seems to be merely “le\n",
      "manoir a l’envers,” indeed one English critic has actually said of\n",
      "Nietzsche, that “Thus Spake Zarathustra” is no more than a compendium of\n",
      "modern views and maxims turned upside down. Examining these heterodox\n",
      "pronouncements a little more closely, however, we may possibly perceive\n",
      "their truth. Regarding good and evil as purely relative values, it\n",
      "stands to reason that what may be bad or evil in a given man, relative\n",
      "to a certain environment, may actually be good if not highly virtuous in\n",

      "therefore, one may unwittingly be doing violence to the greatest in him.\n",
      "It may be an outrage against his wholeness, just as the lopping-off of a\n",
      "leg would be. Fortunately, the natural so-called “wickedness” of higher\n",

      "philosophy, together with all his hopes, enthusiastic outbursts,\n",
      "blasphemies, prolixities, and obscurities, were merely so many gifts\n",
      "laid at the feet of higher men. He had no desire to save the world. What\n",
      "he wished to determine was: Who is to be master of the world? This is a\n",
      "very different thing. He came to save higher men;—to give them that\n",
      "freedom by which, alone, they can develop and reach their zenith (see\n",
      "Note on Chapter LIV., end). It has been argued, and with considerable\n",
      "force, that no such philosophy is required by higher men, that, as a\n",
      "matter of fact, higher men, by virtue of their constitutions always, do\n",
      "stand Beyond Good and Evil, and never allow anything to stand in the way\n",
      "of their complete growth. Nietzsche, however, was evidently not so\n",
      "confident about this. He would probably have argued that we only see the\n",
      "successful cases. Being a great man himself, he was well aware of the\n",
      "dangers threatening greatness in our age. In “Beyond Good and Evil” he\n",
      "writes: “There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or\n",

      "deteriorated...” He knew “from his painfullest recollections on what\n",
      "wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have\n",
      "hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become\n",
      "contemptible.” Now in Part IV. we shall find that his strongest\n",
      "temptation to descend to the feeling of “pity” for his contemporaries,\n",
      "is the “cry for help” which he hears from the lips of the higher men\n",
      "exposed to the dreadful danger of their modern environment.\n",
      "Chapter LXI. The Honey Sacrifice.\n",
      "In the fourteenth verse of this discourse Nietzsche defines the\n",
      "solemn duty he imposed upon himself: “Become what thou art.” Surely the\n",
      "criticism which has been directed against this maxim must all fall to\n",
      "the ground when it is remembered, once and for all, that Nietzsche’s\n",
      "teaching was never intended to be other than an esoteric one. “I am a\n",
      "law only for mine own,” he says emphatically, “I am not a law for all.”\n",
      "It is of the greatest importance to humanity that its highest\n",
      "individuals should be allowed to attain to their full development; for,\n",
      "only by means of its heroes can the human race be led forward step by\n",
      "step to higher and yet higher levels. “Become what thou art” applied to\n",

      "the sin of pity. “I have come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!”\n",
      "says the Soothsayer to Zarathustra. It will be remembered that in\n",
      "Schopenhauer’s ethics, pity is elevated to the highest place among the\n",
      "virtues, and very consistently too, seeing that the Weltanschauung is a\n",
      "pessimistic one. Schopenhauer appeals to Nietzsche’s deepest and\n",
      "strongest sentiment—his sympathy for higher men. “Why dost thou conceal\n",
      "thyself?” he cries. “It is THE HIGHER MAN that calleth for thee!”\n",
      "Zarathustra is almost overcome by the Soothsayer’s pleading, as he had\n",
      "been once already in the past, but he resists him step by step. At\n",
      "length he can withstand him no longer, and, on the plea that the higher\n",
      "man is on his ground and therefore under his protection, Zarathustra\n",

      "kings cross his path. They are above the average modern type; for their\n",
      "instincts tell them what real ruling is, and they despise the mockery\n",
      "which they have been taught to call “Reigning.” “We ARE NOT the first\n",
      "men,” they say, “and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of this\n",
      "imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.” It is the kings\n",
      "who tell Zarathustra: “There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny\n",
      "than when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. There\n",
      "everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous.” The kings are\n",

      "Among the higher men whom Zarathustra wishes to save, is also the\n",
      "scientific specialist—the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues his\n",
      "investigations, as Darwin did, in one department of knowledge. “I love\n",
      "him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the\n",
      "Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.” “The\n",
      "spiritually conscientious one,” he is called in this discourse.\n",
      "Zarathustra steps on him unawares, and the slave of science, bleeding\n",
      "from the violence he has done to himself by his self-imposed task,\n",
      "speaks proudly of his little sphere of knowledge—his little hand’s\n",
      "breadth of ground on Zarathustra’s territory, philosophy. “Where mine\n",
      "honesty ceaseth,” says the true scientific specialist, “there am I blind\n",
      "and want also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want I\n",
      "also to be honest—namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel, and\n",
      "inexorable.” Zarathustra greatly respecting this man, invites him too to\n",
      "the cave, and then vanishes in answer to another cry for help.\n",
      "Chapter LXV. The Magician.\n",
      "The Magician is of course an artist, and Nietzsche’s intimate\n",
      "knowledge of perhaps the greatest artist of his age rendered the\n",
      "selection of Wagner, as the type in this discourse, almost inevitable.\n",
      "Most readers will be acquainted with the facts relating to Nietzsche’s\n",
      "and Wagner’s friendship and ultimate separation. As a boy and a youth\n",
      "Nietzsche had shown such a remarkable gift for music that it had been a\n",
      "question at one time whether he should not perhaps give up everything\n",
      "else in order to develop this gift, but he became a scholar\n",
      "notwithstanding, although he never entirely gave up composing, and\n",
      "playing the piano. While still in his teens, he became acquainted with\n",
      "Wagner’s music and grew passionately fond of it. Long before he met\n",
      "Wagner he must have idealised him in his mind to an extent which only a\n",
      "profoundly artistic nature could have been capable of. Nietzsche always\n",
      "had high ideals for humanity. If one were asked whether, throughout his\n",
      "many changes, there was yet one aim, one direction, and one hope to\n",
      "which he held fast, one would be forced to reply in the affirmative and\n",
      "declare that aim, direction, and hope to have been “the elevation of the\n",
      "type man.” Now, when Nietzsche met Wagner he was actually casting about\n",
      "for an incarnation of his dreams for the German people, and we have only\n",
      "to remember his youth (he was twenty-one when he was introduced to\n",
      "Wagner), his love of Wagner’s music, and the undoubted power of the\n",
      "great musician’s personality, in order to realise how very uncritical\n",
      "his attitude must have been in the first flood of his enthusiasm. Again,\n",
      "when the friendship ripened, we cannot well imagine Nietzsche, the\n",
      "younger man, being anything less than intoxicated by his senior’s\n",
      "attention and love, and we are therefore not surprised to find him\n",
      "pressing Wagner forward as the great Reformer and Saviour of mankind.\n",
      "“Wagner in Bayreuth” (English Edition, 1909) gives us the best proof of\n",
      "Nietzsche’s infatuation, and although signs are not wanting in this\n",
      "essay which show how clearly and even cruelly he was sub-consciously\n",
      "“taking stock” of his friend—even then, the work is a record of what\n",
      "great love and admiration can do in the way of endowing the object of\n",
      "one’s affection with all the qualities and ideals that a fertile\n",
      "imagination can conceive.\n",
      "When the blow came it was therefore all the more severe. Nietzsche at\n",
      "length realised that the friend of his fancy and the real Richard\n",
      "Wagner—the composer of Parsifal—were not one; the fact dawned upon him\n",
      "slowly; disappointment upon disappointment, revelation after revelation,\n",
      "ultimately brought it home to him, and though his best instincts were\n",
      "naturally opposed to it at first, the revulsion of feeling at last\n",
      "became too strong to be ignored, and Nietzsche was plunged into the\n",
      "blackest despair. Years after his break with Wagner, he wrote “The Case\n",
      "of Wagner”, and “Nietzsche contra Wagner”, and these works are with us\n",
      "to prove the sincerity and depth of his views on the man who was the\n",
      "greatest event of his life.\n",
      "The poem in this discourse is, of course, reminiscent of Wagner’s own\n",
      "poetical manner, and it must be remembered that the whole was written\n",
      "subsequent to Nietzsche’s final break with his friend. The dialogue\n",
      "between Zarathustra and the Magician reveals pretty fully what it was\n",
      "that Nietzsche grew to loathe so intensely in Wagner,—viz., his\n",
      "pronounced histrionic tendencies, his dissembling powers, his inordinate\n",
      "vanity, his equivocalness, his falseness. “It honoureth thee,” says\n",
      "Zarathustra, “that thou soughtest for greatness, but it betrayeth thee\n",
      "also. Thou art not great.” The Magician is nevertheless sent as a guest\n",
      "to Zarathustra’s cave; for, in his heart, Zarathustra believed until the\n",
      "end that the Magician was a higher man broken by modern values.\n",

      "Zarathustra now meets the last pope, and, in a poetical form, we get\n",
      "Nietzsche’s description of the course Judaism and Christianity pursued\n",
      "before they reached their final break-up in Atheism, Agnosticism, and\n",
      "the like. The God of a strong, warlike race—the God of Israel—is a\n",
      "jealous, revengeful God. He is a power that can be pictured and endured\n",
      "only by a hardy and courageous race, a race rich enough to sacrifice and\n",
      "to lose in sacrifice. The image of this God degenerates with the people\n",
      "that appropriate it, and gradually He becomes a God of love—“soft and\n",
      "mellow,” a lower middle-class deity, who is “pitiful.” He can no longer\n",
      "be a God who requires sacrifice, for we ourselves are no longer rich\n",
      "enough for that. The tables are therefore turned upon Him; HE must\n",
      "sacrifice to us. His pity becomes so great that he actually does\n",
      "sacrifice something to us—His only begotten Son. Such a process carried\n",
      "to its logical conclusions must ultimately end in His own destruction,\n",
      "and thus we find the pope declaring that God was one day suffocated by\n",
      "His all-too-great pity. What follows is clear enough. Zarathustra\n",
      "recognises another higher man in the ex-pope and sends him too as a\n",
      "guest to the cave.\n",
      "Chapter LXVII. The Ugliest Man.\n",
      "This discourse contains perhaps the boldest of Nietzsche’s\n",
      "suggestions concerning Atheism, as well as some extremely penetrating\n",
      "remarks upon the sentiment of pity. Zarathustra comes across the\n",
      "repulsive creature sitting on the wayside, and what does he do? He\n",
      "manifests the only correct feelings that can be manifested in the\n",
      "presence of any great misery—that is to say, shame, reverence,\n",
      "embarrassment. Nietzsche detested the obtrusive and gushing pity that\n",
      "goes up to misery without a blush either on its cheek or in its\n",
      "heart—the pity which is only another form of self-glorification. “Thank\n",
      "God that I am not like thee!”—only this self-glorifying sentiment can\n",
      "lend a well-constituted man the impudence to SHOW his pity for the\n",
      "cripple and the ill-constituted. In the presence of the ugliest man\n",
      "Nietzsche blushes,—he blushes for his race; his own particular kind of\n",
      "altruism—the altruism that might have prevented the existence of this\n",
      "man—strikes him with all its force. He will have the world otherwise. He\n",
      "will have a world where one need not blush for one’s fellows—hence his\n",
      "appeal to us to love only our children’s land, the land undiscovered in\n",
      "the remotest sea.\n",
      "Zarathustra calls the ugliest man the murderer of God! Certainly,\n",
      "this is one aspect of a certain kind of Atheism—the Atheism of the man\n",
      "who reveres beauty to such an extent that his own ugliness, which\n",
      "outrages him, must be concealed from every eye lest it should not be\n",
      "respected as Zarathustra respected it. If there be a God, He too must be\n",
      "evaded. His pity must be foiled. But God is ubiquitous and omniscient.\n",
      "Therefore, for the really GREAT ugly man, He must not exist. “Their pity\n",
      "IS it from which I flee away,” he says—that is to say: “It is from their\n",
      "want of reverence and lack of shame in presence of my great misery!” The\n",
      "ugliest man despises himself; but Zarathustra said in his Prologue: “I\n",
      "love the great despisers because they are the great adorers, and arrows\n",
      "of longing for the other shore.” He therefore honours the ugliest man:\n",
      "sees height in his self-contempt, and invites him to join the other\n",

      "Chapter LXVIII. The Voluntary Beggar.\n",
      "In this discourse, we undoubtedly have the ideal Buddhist, if not\n",
      "Gautama Buddha himself. Nietzsche had the greatest respect for Buddhism,\n",
      "and almost wherever he refers to it in his works, it is in terms of\n",
      "praise. He recognised that though Buddhism is undoubtedly a religion for\n",
      "decadents, its decadent values emanate from the higher and not, as in\n",
      "Christianity, from the lower grades of society. In Aphorism 20 of “The\n",
      "Antichrist”, he compares it exhaustively with Christianity, and the\n",
      "result of his investigation is very much in favour of the older\n",
      "religion. Still, he recognised a most decided Buddhistic influence in\n",
      "Christ’s teaching, and the words in verses 29, 30, and 31 are very\n",
      "reminiscent of his views in regard to the Christian Savior.\n",
      "The figure of Christ has been introduced often enough into fiction,\n",
      "and many scholars have undertaken to write His life according to their\n",
      "own lights, but few perhaps have ever attempted to present Him to us\n",
      "bereft of all those characteristics which a lack of the sense of harmony\n",
      "has attached to His person through the ages in which His doctrines have\n",
      "been taught. Now Nietzsche disagreed entirely with Renan’s view, that\n",
      "Christ was “le grand maitre en ironie”; in Aphorism 31 of “The\n",
      "Antichrist”, he says that he (Nietzsche) always purged his picture of\n",
      "the Humble Nazarene of all those bitter and spiteful outbursts which, in\n",
      "view of the struggle the first Christians went through, may very well\n",
      "have been added to the original character by Apologists and Sectarians\n",
      "who, at that time, could ill afford to consider nice psychological\n",
      "points, seeing that what they needed, above all, was a wrangling and\n",
      "abusive deity. These two conflicting halves in the character of the\n",
      "Christ of the Gospels, which no sound psychology can ever reconcile,\n",
      "Nietzsche always kept distinct in his own mind; he could not credit the\n",
      "same man with sentiments sometimes so noble and at other times so\n",
      "vulgar, and in presenting us with this new portrait of the Saviour,\n",
      "purged of all impurities, Nietzsche rendered military honours to a foe,\n",
      "which far exceed in worth all that His most ardent disciples have ever\n",
      "claimed for Him. In verse 26 we are vividly reminded of Herbert\n",

      "Here we have a description of that courageous and wayward spirit that\n",
      "literally haunts the footsteps of every great thinker and every great\n",
      "leader; sometimes with the result that it loses all aims, all hopes, and\n",
      "all trust in a definite goal. It is the case of the bravest and most\n",
      "broad-minded men of to-day. These literally shadow the most daring\n",
      "movements in the science and art of their generation; they completely\n",
      "lose their bearings and actually find themselves, in the end, without a\n",
      "way, a goal, or a home. “On every surface have I already sat!...I become\n",
      "thin, I am almost equal to a shadow!” At last, in despair, such men do\n",
      "indeed cry out: “Nothing is true; all is permitted,” and then they\n",
      "become mere wreckage. “Too much hath become clear unto me: now nothing\n",
      "mattereth to me any more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love,—how\n",
      "should I still love myself! Have I still a goal? Where is MY home?”\n",
      "Zarathustra realises the danger threatening such a man. “Thy danger is\n",
      "not small, thou free spirit and wanderer,” he says. “Thou hast had a bad\n",
      "day. See that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee!” The danger\n",
      "Zarathustra refers to is precisely this, that even a prison may seem a\n",
      "blessing to such a man. At least the bars keep him in a place of rest; a\n",
      "place of confinement, at its worst, is real. “Beware lest in the end a\n",

      "alone can he be of use to him. Nietzsche would be a hard bed to higher\n",
      "men. He would make them harder; for, in order to be a law unto himself,\n",
