# List of Blogs by Alumni of the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia

I endeavor to compile and gather all Pacilian blogs to integrate the consciousness of Pacilians.

These are the websites I have visited since before I entered college, when I was searching for information to enroll in university, up until my college years to gather information.

I found these websites through Google searches, and sometimes, seniors or friends promoted their websites, prompting me to visit them.
