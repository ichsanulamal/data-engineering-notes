Venture capital funds sort through hundreds of investment applications in a methodical and effective way by following a structured process that involves several key steps. The typical process includes:

1. **Sourcing Opportunities**: Venture capital firms employ various methods to identify promising startups, such as attending industry events, networking with entrepreneurs and industry experts, and leveraging their own professional networks[2].

2. **Pitching to Investors**: The first stage in the investment process is the pitch, where the founders have the opportunity to present their business to the investors[5].

3. **Due Diligence**: If interested in the proposal, the firm or the investor performs due diligence to evaluate the potential investment opportunity thoroughly[3].

4. **Interviews and Negotiations**: After the initial evaluation, selected companies are invited to interview with the fund. Based on the interviews, final negotiations are made to secure the investment[1].

5. **Formal Investment**: Upon successful negotiations, the venture capital fund will formally invest in a select few companies[1].

6. **Post-Investment Support**: The companies that receive investment join the fund's accelerator, where they undergo a 6-month boot camp to help build the fundamentals of a high-growth company[1].

This process allows venture capital funds to filter through numerous opportunities and identify the most promising and viable investment prospects.

The key criteria for the investment selection process in the venture capital context can include factors such as historical revenue, user growth, technical expertise of founders, market opportunity, and funding already raised. To rank these criteria, one can consider creating a grading scale based on their importance. For example, a grading scale out of 10 points can be used, with allocation of points to each criterion based on its significance in the investment decision-making process.

Here are the 3-6 key criteria for the investment selection process that can be used to improve the current grading scale:
1. Historical Revenue
2. User Growth
3. Technical Expertise of Founders
4. Market Opportunity
5. Funding Already Raised

The grading scale can be created as follows:
- Historical Revenue: 9/10
- User Growth: 8/10
- Technical Expertise of Founders: 9/10
- Market Opportunity: 10/10
- Funding Already Raised: 7/10

This approach allows for a systematic evaluation of start-ups seeking investment, taking into account the varying importance of different criteria in the decision-making process.
