# Standardizing a Factor in Quantitative Trading

Given a factor vector 

$\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$:

1. **Compute the Mean**:
   $$
   \mu_x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
   $$

2. **De-mean the Factor**:
   $$
   \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} - \mu_x = [x_1 - \mu_x, x_2 - \mu_x, \ldots, x_n - \mu_x]
   $$
   This ensures that the sum of the weights is zero:
   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^n y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu_x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n \mu_x = 0
   $$

3. **Compute the Sum of Absolute Values**:
   $$
   S = \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i|
   $$

4. **Re-scale the De-meaned Factor**:
   $$
   \mathbf{z} = \frac{\mathbf{y}}{S} = \left[ \frac{y_1}{S}, \frac{y_2}{S}, \ldots, \frac{y_n}{S} \right]
   $$
   This ensures that the sum of the absolute values equals one:
   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i| = \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \frac{y_i}{S} \right| = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i| = \frac{1}{S} S = 1
   $$

# Zipline Pipeline in Quantitative Trading

Zipline is a Pythonic algorithmic trading library that facilitates backtesting of trading strategies. One of its powerful features is the `Pipeline` API, which allows users to build complex data pipelines to screen and rank stocks.

This tutorial will guide you through the essentials of the Zipline Pipeline, covering its core components, how to create a pipeline, and how to integrate it into a trading algorithm.

## Introduction to Zipline Pipeline

The Zipline Pipeline is designed to streamline the process of selecting and ranking securities based on various factors. It enables you to combine multiple data sources, perform transformations, and apply filters in a flexible and efficient manner.

### Core Components of a Pipeline

1. **Factors**: Quantitative metrics used to rank securities. Examples include price-to-earnings ratios, momentum, and volatility.
2. **Filters**: Boolean conditions used to include or exclude securities from the pipeline. Examples include market capitalization thresholds or liquidity requirements.
3. **Classifiers**: Categorical data used to group or label securities. Examples include sector classifications or exchange listings.

### Creating a Pipeline

To create a pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Define Factors, Filters, and Classifiers**: These components are combined to form a `Pipeline` object.
2. **Attach the Pipeline to the Algorithm**: Use the `attach_pipeline` function to integrate the pipeline into your algorithm.
3. **Fetch Pipeline Output**: Use the `pipeline_output` function to retrieve the pipelineâ€™s results.

### Example: Building a Simple Pipeline

#### Step 1: Define Factors and Filters

First, we import the necessary modules and define our factors and filters. In this example, we create a momentum factor and a filter to select stocks with a market capitalization above a certain threshold.

```python
from zipline.pipeline import Pipeline
from zipline.pipeline.data import USEquityPricing
from zipline.pipeline.factors import SimpleMovingAverage
from zipline.pipeline.filters import StaticAssets
from zipline.api import attach_pipeline, pipeline_output
from zipline import run_algorithm
from datetime import datetime

# Define the moving average factor (momentum)
momentum = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[USEquityPricing.close], window_length=20)

# Define a static filter for specific assets
universe = StaticAssets([sid(24), sid(8554), sid(5061)])  # Example SIDs

# Create a Pipeline
pipe = Pipeline(
    columns={
        'momentum': momentum
    },
    screen=universe
)
```

#### Step 2: Attach the Pipeline to the Algorithm

Next, we define the initialization function for our algorithm, where we attach the pipeline.

```python
def initialize(context):
    attach_pipeline(pipe, 'my_pipeline')

def before_trading_start(context, data):
    context.output = pipeline_output('my_pipeline')
    context.security_list = context.output.index
```

#### Step 3: Use Pipeline Output in Trading Logic

Now, we can use the pipeline output in our trading logic. For simplicity, we will print the pipeline output each day.

```python
def handle_data(context, data):
    print(context.output)
```

#### Step 4: Run the Algorithm

Finally, we set the algorithm parameters and run it.

```python
start = datetime(2023, 1, 1)
end = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
capital_base = 100000

result = run_algorithm(
    start=start,
    end=end,
    initialize=initialize,
    capital_base=capital_base,
    handle_data=handle_data,
    before_trading_start=before_trading_start,
    data_frequency='daily'
)
```
