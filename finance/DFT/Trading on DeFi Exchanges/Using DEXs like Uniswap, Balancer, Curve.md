Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve have become pivotal in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Each of these platforms offers unique features and benefits, catering to different trading needs and strategies. This guide provides an overview of how to use these popular DEXs, along with tips for maximizing your trading experience.

#### Uniswap
