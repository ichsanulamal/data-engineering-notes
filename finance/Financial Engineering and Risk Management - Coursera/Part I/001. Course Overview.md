### Financial Engineering and Risk Management Overview

---

**Course Introduction:**

- Overview of financial markets and products
- Key problems in financial engineering
- Practical applications in risk management

---

**Importance of Financial Markets:**

1. **Efficient Allocation of Resources:**
   - **Across Time:** Allocating current income for future use
   - **Across States of Nature:** Managing uncertain future income and costs

---

**Example - Young Worker:**

- Invest in stocks and bonds for future needs
- Without financial markets, unable to transfer wealth effectively over time

---

**Example - Farmer Producing Oranges:**

- **With Financial Markets:** 
  - Hedge future prices using futures market
  - Protect against weather risks with derivatives
- **Without Financial Markets:**
  - Exposed to market and weather risks

---

**Functions of Markets:**

1. **Information Gathering:**
   - Aggregates buyers' and sellers' information
   - Reflects in the product prices

2. **Liquidity Aggregation:**
   - Central place for buyers and sellers
   - Better prices through aggregated liquidity

3. **Promoting Efficiency and Fairness:**

---

**Financial Products:**

- Hedge risk
- Allow speculation
- Raise funds (e.g., IPOs)
- Fund liabilities

---

**Market Models:**

1. **Discrete Time Models:**
   - Time advances in steps
   - Simpler mathematics
   - Solutions require numerical methods

2. **Continuous Time Models:**
   - Time advances continuously
   - Complex mathematics
   - Closed-form solutions

---

**Course Focus:**

- Discrete time multi-period models
- Simple mathematics to introduce key concepts
- Some continuous time concepts (e.g., Black-Scholes formula)

---

**Financial Economics vs. Financial Engineering:**

1. **Financial Economics:**
   - Prices primary assets using equilibrium concepts

2. **Financial Engineering:**
   - Prices derivatives based on primary assets using no arbitrage condition

---

**Central Problems in Financial Engineering:**

1. **Security Pricing:**
   - Pricing derivatives like forwards, swaps, futures, and options

2. **Portfolio Selection:**
   - Maximizing utility of consumption and wealth
   - Markowitz portfolio selection model widely used

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Understanding risks in a given portfolio
   - Stress testing under different market conditions
   - Key measures: Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

---

**Interdisciplinary Applications:**

- Combining supply chain management with financial engineering
- Hedging operational risks using financial products

---

**Conclusion:**
