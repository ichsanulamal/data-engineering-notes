# Floating Rate Bonds and Arbitrage Pricing

## Introduction to Floating Rate Bonds

- **Floating Rate Bonds**: Bonds with interest rates or coupon payments dependent on prevailing market interest rates.
- **Objective**: Understand how to price these bonds using arbitrage principles and the term structure of interest rates.

---

## Linear Pricing and Arbitrage Principle

- **Linear Pricing**: Combines prices of different cash flows.
- **No Arbitrage Principle**: Ensures prices are consistent and prevents "free lunch" opportunities.
  - Cash Flow Example:
    - Cash Flow \(C_A\) priced at \(P_A\)
    - Cash Flow \(C_B\) priced at \(P_B\)
    - Combined Cash Flow \(C = C_A + C_B\)
    - Price \(P = P_A + P_B\)

---

## Pricing a Floating Rate Bond

- **Floating Rate Bond**: Coupons vary based on market interest rates.
- **Cash Flow Analysis**:
  - Decompose complex cash flows into simpler, deterministic cash flows.
  - Use Net Present Value (NPV) to price individual cash flows.

---

## Example: Cash Flow Decomposition

- **Cash Flow \(C\)** paying \(C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_T\)
  - Portfolio of simpler cash flows: \(C_t\) pays \(c_t\) at time \(t\)
  - NPV Calculation:
    - \( \text{Price} = \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} \)
  - **Principle**: Price of total cash flow equals the sum of individual NPVs.

---

## Floating Rate Bonds and Random Interest Rates

- **Floating Interest Rates**: Interest rates \(R_k\) known only at time \(k\).
  - Coupon at time \(k\) based on rate \(R_{k-1}\).
- **Objective**: Compute the arbitrage-free price \(P_F\).

---

## Decomposing Floating Rate Bond Cash Flows

- **Principal Payment \(P\)**: NPV of face value \(F\).
  - \( P = \frac{F}{(1 + R_0)^N} \)
- **Coupon Payments**: 
  - Decompose into simpler cash flows \(C_k\) paying \(R_{k-1} \times F\).
  - Price \(P_k = \frac{R_0 \times F}{(1 + R_0)^k}\)

---

## Calculating the Price of a Floating Rate Bond

- **Total Price \(P_F\)**:
  - Sum of principal and coupon prices.
  - \( P_F = P + \sum_{k=1}^{N} P_k \)
  - **Result**: The price of a floating rate bond equals its face value \(F\).

---

## Term Structure of Interest Rates

- **Term Structure**: Interest rate depends on loan duration.
- **Spot Rate \(S_T\)**: Rate for a loan maturing in \(T\) years.
  - \( \text{Present Value} = \frac{A}{(1 + S_T)^T} \)

---

## Forward Rates

- **Forward Rate \(F_{UV}\)**: Interest rate for lending from year \(U\) to \(V\).
  - **Calculation**: Ensures no arbitrage condition.
  - Relationship:
    - \( 1 + S_V = (1 + S_U) \times (1 + F_{UV}) \)
    - \( F_{UV} = \left( \frac{(1 + S_V)^V}{(1 + S_U)^U} \right)^{\frac{1}{V-U}} - 1 \)

---

## Summary

1. **Floating Rate Bonds**:
   - Price equals face value.
2. **Linear Pricing**:
   - Combines prices of simpler cash flows.
3. **Term Structure**:
   - Spot and forward rates reflect loan durations and market conditions.
4. **Arbitrage-Free Pricing**:
   - Ensures consistent and fair pricing.
