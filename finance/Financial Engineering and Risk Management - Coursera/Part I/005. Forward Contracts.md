### Introduction to Forward Contracts

#### Overview
- **Forward Contract Definition**: An agreement to buy a specified amount of an asset at a future date \( T \) at a predetermined price \( F \), set at \( t = 0 \).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Buyer has the right and obligation to purchase the asset.
  - The forward price \( F \) is set at the contract's inception.

#### Mechanics
- **Timeline**:
  - \( t = 0 \): Contract initiation, setting price \( F \).
  - \( T \): Contract expiration, asset purchase at price \( F \).
- **Examples**:
  - Delivery of stock in 6 months.
  - Sale of gold in 1 year.
  - Purchase of Euros in 3 months.
  - Delivery of a 9-month T-bill in 3 months.

### Setting the Forward Price \( F \)

#### Objective
- Determine the forward price \( F \) for a contract at \( t = 0 \) for an asset with current price \( S_t \) at time \( T \).

#### Forward Contract Value
- **Value at Expiration \( T \)**: 
  - \( f(T) = S_T - F \)
  - Profit/loss based on the difference between spot price \( S_T \) and forward price \( F \).

#### No Arbitrage Principle
- **Forward Price \( F \)**: 
  - Set such that \( f_0 = 0 \) (value at contract initiation).
  - Indifference between taking a long or short position.

### Short Selling

#### Concept
- **Definition**: Selling shares not owned by borrowing them from a broker.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Sell borrowed shares, receive proceeds.
  - Buy back shares later to return to the broker (covering).

#### Risk and Reward
- **Profit**: If asset price drops.
- **Loss**: If asset price rises (potentially unbounded).

#### Application in Forward Pricing
- **Portfolio Construction**:
  - Buy forward contract.
  - Short sell the underlying asset.
  - Lend \( S_0 \) up to time \( T \).

### Cash Flows and No Arbitrage

#### Cash Flow Analysis
- **Initial Cash Flow (\( t = 0 \))**: 
  - \( f_0 = 0 \).
- **Cash Flow at Expiration (\( T \))**:
  - From forward: \( S_T - F \).
  - From short selling: \( S_0 - S_T \).
  - From lending: \( S_0 / d(0, T) \).

#### Deterministic Cash Flow
- **Net Cash Flow at \( T \)**:
  - \( S_0 / d(0, T) - F \).
- **Discounted Cash Flow**:
  - \( F = S_0 / d(0, T) \).
  - Reflects cost of carry (opportunity cost of cash).

### Example Calculation

#### Non-Dividend Paying Stock
- **Stock Price**: $50
- **Maturity**: 6 months
- **Interest Rate**: 4% per annum, semi-annual compounding.

#### Discount Rate
- **Calculation**:
  - \( 1 + \frac{0.04}{2} = 0.9804 \).
- **Forward Price \( F \)**:
  - \( F = \frac{50}{0.9804} = 51 \).

### Value of Forward Contract at Intermediate Time \( t \)

#### Value Calculation
- **Time \( t \)**: Not 0 or \( T \).
- **Forward Price \( F_t \)**: Negotiated at \( t \) for delivery at \( T \).

#### Portfolio Construction
- **Short \( F_t \)**: Pay nothing at \( t \).
- **Long \( F_0 \)**: Pay \( F_t \) at \( t \).
- **Cash Flow Analysis**:
  - \( T \): \( S_T - F_0 \).
  - Net Cash Flow: \( F_t - F_0 \).

#### Final Value
- **Discounted Value**:
  - \( f_t = \frac{F_t - F_0}{d(t, T)} \).
