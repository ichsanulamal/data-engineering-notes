### Introduction to Swap Contracts

---

**What are Swap Contracts?**
- Swap contracts transform one type of cash flow into another.
- **Types of Swaps:**
  - **Interest Rate Swap:** Fixed interest rate cash flow is swapped for a floating interest rate cash flow.
  - **Commodity Swap:** Floating price of a commodity is exchanged for a fixed price (e.g., gold swaps, oil swaps).
  - **Currency Swap:** Cash flow in one currency is exchanged for a cash flow in another currency.

**Why Construct Swaps?**
- **Change Nature of Cash Flows:**
  - Example: Switching from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
- **Leverage Market Strengths:**
  - Companies can take advantage of their strengths in different markets to create a better financial outcome.

---

**Example: Interest Rate Swap**
1. **Company A:**
   - Borrows at a fixed rate of 4% per annum.
   - Borrows at a floating rate of LIBOR + 0.3%.
2. **Company B:**
   - Borrows at a fixed rate of 5.2% per annum.
   - Borrows at a floating rate of LIBOR + 1%.

---

**Swap Construction:**
- **Goal:** To leverage relative market strengths for a better deal.
- **Process:**
  - **Company A** (stronger in fixed-rate market) borrows at 4%.
  - **Company B** (stronger in floating-rate market) borrows at LIBOR + 1%.
  - They construct a swap to exchange cash flows, benefiting both parties.

---

**Net Effect of Swap:**
- **Company A:**
  - Ends up paying LIBOR + 0.05%.
  - Gains better terms than direct floating rate borrowing.
- **Company B:**
  - Ends up paying 4.95%.
  - Gains better terms than direct fixed-rate borrowing.
- **Outcome:** Both companies achieve better financial terms through the swap.

---

**Role of Financial Intermediary:**
- **Purpose:**
  - Mitigate counterparty default risk.
  - Facilitate the construction of swaps between companies.
- **Example:**
  - **Company A:** Borrows at 4%, swaps with intermediary, receives 3.93%.
  - **Company B:** Borrows at LIBOR + 1%, swaps with intermediary, receives 3.97%.
  - **Intermediary:** Takes on counterparty risk and earns a small spread (e.g., 0.04%).

---

**Pricing an Interest Rate Swap:**
- **Setup:**
  - Denote floating interest rate at time \( t \) as \( r_t \).
  - Company A (long position) receives \( n \times r_{t-1} \) and pays \( n \times x \).
  - Company B (short position) pays \( n \times r_{t-1} \) and receives \( n \times x \).

---

**Value Calculation:**
- **Value to Company A:**
  - **Floating Rate Payments:**
    - Receives \( n \times r_0, r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{T-1} \).
  - **Fixed Rate Payments:**
    - Pays \( n \times x \) at each period.

- **Formula:**
  - **Value of Floating Payments:** 
    - \( n \) (notional principal) minus discounted value of the principal \( n \times d(0, T) \).
  - **Value of Fixed Payments:**
    - Discounted sum of fixed payments.

---

**Setting the Fixed Rate \( x \):**
- To ensure the swap's value is zero at inception:
  - \( x = \frac{1 - d(0, T)}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} d(0, t)} \).
- **Outcome:** Both companies are indifferent to taking a long or short position.
