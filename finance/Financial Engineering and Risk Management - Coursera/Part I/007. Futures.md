### Introduction to Futures

---

#### Overview
- **Definition**: Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an asset at a predetermined future date and price.
- **Purpose**: Futures are primarily used for hedging and speculation.

#### Key Points
- **Forwards vs. Futures**: Forwards are customized contracts traded over-the-counter (OTC) with no standardization, leading to price and counterparty risks. Futures are standardized and traded on exchanges, mitigating these risks.

### Why Futures Are Needed

---

#### Limitations of Forward Contracts
- **Price Multiplicity**: Different prices for contracts expiring at the same time, creating complexity and lack of price transparency.
- **Counterparty Risk**: Risk of default if the counterparty fails to honor the contract.
- **Double-Coincidence-of-Wants**: Difficulty in finding a matching counterparty.

#### Benefits of Futures
- **Standardization**: Ensures uniformity and ease of trading.
- **Price Transparency**: Facilitates fair pricing through supply and demand.
- **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: Exchange acts as an intermediary, reducing default risk.

### Mechanics of Futures Contracts

---

#### Setting Up a Futures Contract
1. **Open a Margin Account**: Required to manage potential gains and losses.
2. **Initial Margin**: Typically 5-10% of the contract value, varying by whether you're a hedger or speculator.
3. **Daily Settlement**: Profits and losses are marked to market daily.

#### Example: Futures Pricing
- **Single Price for Maturity**: Unlike forwards, futures have a single price due to daily settlements.
- **Wide Range of Underlying Assets**: Can be written on commodities, indices, and even market volatility.

### Hedging with Futures

---

#### Hedging Strategies
1. **Long Hedge**: Protects against price increases.
   - Example: A baker hedges the cost of wheat needed in the future.
2. **Short Hedge**: Protects against price decreases.

#### Practical Example
- **Scenario**: A baker needs 500 bushels of wheat by December 1st.
- **Strategy**: Buy futures contracts to fix the price.
- **Cash Flow at Maturity**: The futures position offsets the spot market price, effectively locking in the cost.

### Pros and Cons of Futures

---

#### Pros
- **High Leverage**: Control large positions with relatively small upfront margins.
- **Liquidity**: Easy to enter and exit positions.
- **Diverse Underlying Assets**: Hedge or speculate on various assets.

#### Cons
- **High Risk**: Leverage increases potential losses.
- **Linear Payoffs**: Only suitable for linear cash flow hedging.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Standardized contracts may not fit all hedging needs.

### Pricing Futures

---

#### Martingale Pricing Formalism
- **Stochastic Interest Rates**: Requires advanced methods for pricing.
- **Deterministic Rates**: Futures and forward prices are equivalent, simplifying pricing through arbitrage arguments.

### Hedging Example with Basis Risk

---

#### Imperfect Hedge Scenario
- **Example**: A taco company needs to hedge the cost of kidney beans using soybean futures due to lack of specific futures.
- **Basis Risk**: Difference between the spot price of the underlying asset and the futures price.
- **Optimal Hedge Ratio**: Minimize variance of the cash flow using the formula:

\[ y = - \frac{\text{Cov}(F_T, P_T)}{\text{Var}(F_T)} \]

### Conclusion

---

- **Futures**: Effective tools for hedging and speculation with standardized terms and reduced counterparty risk.
- **Basis Risk**: Present when hedging with correlated but different assets, requiring careful calculation to minimize risk.
- **Practical Use**: In-depth understanding and application in financial strategies can significantly mitigate market risks.
