#### Simulated Data Worksheet
1. **Purpose of Simulation**:
   - To demonstrate margin calls and their impact on the margin account.

2. **Simulation Setup**:
   - Corn price follows a random walk.
   - Volatility based on historical data.
   - Multiple simulations to show different scenarios.

3. **Example Simulation with Margin Call**:
