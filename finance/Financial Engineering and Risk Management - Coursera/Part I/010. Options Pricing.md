## Module Overview: Pricing Options in the Binomial Model

### Introduction to the Binomial Model
- **Goal**: Understand how to price options using the binomial model.
- **Structure**: 
  1. Introduction to key questions.
  2. Study of the 1-period and multi-period binomial models.
  3. Discussion on replicating strategies for pricing options.
  4. Examination of European and American options within the binomial model.
  5. Introduction to the Black-Scholes formula and its relation to the binomial model.

### Binomial Model Basics
- **Stock Price Movement**:
  - Initial stock price: \( S_0 = \$100 \).
  - Each period: Stock price can go up to $107 or down to $93.46.
  - Factor representation: Up move by a factor \( u \), down move by a factor \( d \) (where \( d = \frac{1}{u} \)).

### Recombining Tree
- **Properties**:
  - An up move followed by a down move results in the same price as a down move followed by an up move.
  - This leads to a recombining tree structure.

### Probabilities in the Model
- **Assumptions**:
  - Probability of an up move (\( p \)).
  - Probability of a down move (\( 1-p \)).
  - Probabilities are constant at every node in the tree.

### Risk-Free Asset
- **Definition**:
  - Risk-free asset or cash account grows at a rate \( r \) per period.
  - $1 invested at \( t = 0 \) will be worth \( r^t \) dollars at time \( t \).

### Key Questions in Pricing Options
- **Example**: How much is an option worth that pays \( \max(0, S_3 - 100) \) at \( t = 3 \)?
  - Analyzing different nodes and calculating potential payoffs.

### Impact of Utility Functions
- **Question**: Should the option price depend on the utility functions of the buyer and seller?
  - **Utility Function**:
    - Represents the value a buyer or seller gets from the security.
    - Should be increasing (more wealth preferred) and concave (diminishing returns to wealth).

### St. Petersburg Paradox
- **Example Game**:
  - Fair coin tossed until first head appears.
  - Payoff: \( 2^n \) dollars if the first head appears on the \( n \)-th toss.
  - **Expected Payoff**: Infinity.
  - **Realistic Payoff**: People wouldn't pay an infinite amount; they compute based on utility.

### Resolving the Paradox with Utility
- **Bernoulli's Solution**:
  - Use of a log utility function.
  - **Expected Utility**: Finite value calculated using the sum of the log of payoffs multiplied by their probabilities.

### Practical Pricing of Options
- **Approach**:
  - Instead of relying on individual utility functions, a simpler method will be used for pricing options in practice.
