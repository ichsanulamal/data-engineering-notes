### Module Overview: Pricing Options with the 1-Period Binomial Model

---

#### Introduction

- Last module: Introduction to the 1-Period Binomial Model and no arbitrage conditions.
- This module: Continue with the 1-Period Binomial Model to price options.

---

#### Assumptions and Model Setup

- **Initial Stock Price:** $100
- **Stock Price at Time 1:**
  - **Up Move:** $107
  - **Down Move:** $93.46
- **Gross Risk-Free Rate:** 1.01 (e.g., $100 invested at time 0 becomes $101 at time 1)
- **Option Strike Price:** $102

---

#### Constructing a Replicating Portfolio

- **Objective:** Determine the value of a call option at time 1.
- **Payoff Calculation:**
  - If stock price = $107, payoff = $5 ($107 - $102)
  - If stock price = $93.46, payoff = $0 (option not exercised)
- **Replicating Portfolio:** Buying x shares of the stock and investing y dollars in cash.
- **Portfolio Value at Time 1:**
  - **Up Move:** $107x + 1.01y
  - **Down Move:** $93.46x + 1.01y

---

#### Solving for x and y

- **Equations:**
  - \( 107x + 1.01y = 5 \)
  - \( 93.46x + 1.01y = 0 \)
- **Solution:**
  - \( x = 0.3693 \)
  - \( y = -34.1708 \)

---

#### Interpretation and Cost of Replicating Portfolio

- **Negative y Value:** Borrowing $34.1708 at the risk-free rate.
- **Cost of Portfolio:**
  - Stock cost: \( 0.3693 \times 100 = 36.93 \)
  - Borrowed amount: \( -34.1708 \)
  - **Total Cost:** $2.76

---

#### Arbitrage-Free Pricing

- **Fair Value of Option:** $2.76
- **Arbitrage Opportunities:**
  - If market price < $2.76: Buy option, sell replicating portfolio for profit.
  - If market price > $2.76: Sell option, buy replicating portfolio for profit.

---

#### Generalizing the Model

- **Deriving General Formula:**
  - **Initial Stock Price:** \( S_0 \)
  - **Stock Prices at Time 1:**
    - Up: \( u \times S_0 \)
    - Down: \( d \times S_0 \)
  - **Payoff of Derivative:**
    - Up: \( C_u \)
    - Down: \( C_d \)
  - **Replicating Portfolio:** \( x \) shares and \( y \) dollars in cash.
  - **Equations:**
    - \( uS_0x + 1.01y = C_u \)
    - \( dS_0x + 1.01y = C_d \)
  - **Solution:**
    - **Fair Value:** \( C_0 = \frac{1}{R} \left( qC_u + (1 - q)C_d \right) \)
    - **Risk-Neutral Probabilities:** \( q = \frac{R - d}{u - d} \)

---

#### Practical Implications

- **Independence from True Probability \( p \):**
  - Fair value of the option does not depend on \( p \).
  - Example with different stocks (ABC and XYZ) showing same option value despite different probabilities.

---

#### Conclusion

- **Risk-Neutral Pricing:** Fundamental concept in finance.
- **Multi-Period Binomial Models:** Extension of current model.
- **Future Discussion:** Resolve the apparent contradiction about the dependency on true probabilities.

---

#### Reflection Question

- **Why is the fair option price the same despite different probabilities of up moves?**

- Continue exploring the multi-period binomial models.
- Deep dive into risk-neutral pricing in complex scenarios.
