### Extending to Multi-Period Binomial Model

**Introduction**
- We're expanding from the one-period to the multi-period binomial model.
- We'll use our one-period results to easily handle the multi-period model.

**3-Period Binomial Model Overview**
- Stock price \(S_0 = \$100\)
- Gross risk-free rate \(r = 1.01\) per period
- Stock price can go up by a factor \(u = 1.07\) or down by \(d = 0.9346\)
- True probabilities: up-move \(p\), down-move \(1-p\)
- Risk-neutral probabilities: \(q\) and \(1-q\)

**Multi-Period Model as Series of One-Period Models**
- Multi-period model is a series of one-period models spliced together.
- For instance, from \(t = 2\) to \(t = 3\), there are three possible one-period models.

**Risk-Neutral Probabilities**
- Risk-neutral probabilities \(q = \frac{r - d}{u - d}\) are the same for each one-period model.
- These probabilities help compute option prices at different nodes.

**Pricing Options in Multi-Period Model**
- Price options in a 3-period model by using one-period model results.
- For instance, calculate the value at each node and work backward from \(t=3\) to \(t=0\).

**Working Backwards Method**
1. Start at \(t=3\) and determine option prices at each node.
2. Move to \(t=2\) and use one-period model results to compute values.
3. Continue to \(t=1\) and finally to \(t=0\).

**Example Calculations**
- Determine the fair value of a European call option with a strike price of \$100.
- Payoff at \(t=3\):
  - 0 at nodes where stock price \(< \$100\)
  - \( \$7\) at node with stock price 107
  - \( \$22.5\) at node with stock price 122.5
- Use risk-neutral probabilities to compute expected payoff and discount back to \(t=0\).

**One-Shot Calculation Method**
- Alternatively, calculate option price in one step:
  - \(C_0 = \frac{1}{r^3} \times \mathbb{E}[(S_T - K)^+]\) using risk-neutral probabilities.
  
**General Approach**
- This method can be applied to any derivative security in the model.
- Compute payoffs at \(t=3\) and use risk-neutral pricing in one calculation or work backwards period-by-period.

**Replicating Strategy**
- The concept of a replicating strategy will be discussed in a future module.

**Conclusion**
- Extending the binomial model to multiple periods allows for detailed option pricing using the same principles from the one-period model.
- The process involves either working backwards through each period or using a single calculation with risk-neutral probabilities.
