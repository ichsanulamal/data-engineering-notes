### Understanding Option Pricing in Binomial Models

---

**Introduction**
- We previously discussed a scenario with two identical securities but differing probabilities of an up move.
- One security had a 0.99 probability of an up move, and the other had a 0.01 probability.
- Surprisingly, both securities had the same option prices.

**Binomial Model Recap**
- We had two stocks: ABC and XYZ, identical except for their up/down probabilities.
- ABC: 0.99 up, 0.01 down.
- XYZ: 0.01 up, 0.99 down.
- Both had a call option with a payoff of the maximum of \( S_1 - 100 \) and 0.

**Expected Payoff**
- Call option payoff: $10 or $0.
- ABC: 0.99 probability of $10.
- XYZ: 0.01 probability of $10.

**Option Price Calculation**
- Despite different probabilities, both call options were valued at approximately $4.80.
- This appears counterintuitive, as higher probabilities should imply higher values.

**Theoretical Explanation**
- In a no-arbitrage market, option prices depend on risk-neutral probabilities, not actual probabilities.
- Risk-neutral valuation: \( C_0 = \frac{1}{R} \times \text{Expected Payoff} \).
- True probabilities (p) do not affect option pricing under no-arbitrage conditions.

**Understanding the Confusion**
- The surprising result stems from an unrealistic scenario: two such different stocks would not coexist in the same economy.
- The confusion should focus on the implausibility of the scenario, not on the option pricing theory.

**Extended Example**
- Consider a three-period binomial model:
  - Stock price \( S_0 = 100 \).
  - Up factor \( u = 1.06 \), down factor \( d \).
  - Gross risk-free rate \( R = 1.02 \).
  - European call option with strike \( K = 95 \).

**Option Pricing with Different Risk-Free Rates**
- With \( R = 1.02 \), option price = $11.04.
- With \( R = 1.04 \), option price = $15.64.
- Higher interest rate increases the option price, contrary to deterministic present value calculations.

**Risk-Neutral Probabilities and No-Arbitrage**
- No-arbitrage condition: \( d < R < u \).
- Derivative pricing using risk-neutral probabilities ensures no-arbitrage.
- Risk-neutral valuation implies no arbitrage opportunities exist.
- This principle is part of the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing: no-arbitrage and the existence of risk-neutral probabilities are equivalent.

---

**Key Takeaways**
- Option prices in a binomial model depend on risk-neutral probabilities, not actual probabilities.
- Unrealistic scenarios can lead to confusion; focus on the plausibility of economic conditions.
- No-arbitrage conditions and risk-neutral probabilities are fundamental to consistent option pricing.
