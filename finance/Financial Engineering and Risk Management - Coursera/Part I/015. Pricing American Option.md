### Pricing American Options in the Binomial Model

**European vs. American Options**
- **European options**: Can only be exercised at expiration.
- **American options**: Can be exercised at any time before expiration.

**Binomial Model Recap**
- We start at the end (t=3) and work backwards, computing the option value at each node until we reach the present (t=0).

**American Option Pricing**
- Same process as European options but with an additional step: check if early exercise is optimal at each node.

**Steps for Pricing American Options**
1. **Compute Payoff at Expiration**: Calculate the payoff at t=3 for all possible stock prices.
2. **Work Backwards**: For each node, calculate the option value considering both the possibility of early exercise and the continuation value.
3. **Optimal Exercise Check**: At each node, compare the immediate exercise value to the continuation value:
    - **Exercise**: If the immediate value is higher.
    - **Continue**: Otherwise.

**Example Calculation**
- **Stock Price Tree**: Assumed to go up (u) or down (d) each period from an initial price of $100.
- **Put Option**: Strike price = $100, expiration at t=3, risk-free rate = 1.01.
- **Payoff at t=3**:
    - Stock Prices: $81.63, $93.46, $107, $122.5.
    - Payoffs: $18.37, $6.54, $0, $0.
- **Backward Calculation**:
    - Calculate continuation value.
    - Compare with immediate exercise value.
    - Choose the higher value.
- **Fair Value of the American Put Option**: $3.82.

### Optimal Stopping Problem: Die Throwing Game

**Game Description**
- **Die**: Fair six-sided die.
- **Throws**: Maximum of three throws.
- **Objective**: Decide whether to stop and take the current value or throw again to potentially get a higher value.

**Strategy for the Game**
1. **Last Throw**:
    - Fair value = 3.5 (average of 1 to 6).
2. **Two Throws Remaining**:
    - If throw results in 1, 2, or 3: Continue (expected value of 3.5 is higher).
    - If throw results in 4, 5, or 6: Stop (value is higher than expected 3.5).
    - Fair value = 4.25.
3. **Three Throws Remaining**:
    - If throw results in 1, 2, 3, or 4: Continue (expected value of 4.25 is higher).
    - If throw results in 5 or 6: Stop.
    - Fair value = 4.5.

**Conclusion**
- This game illustrates the concept of optimal stopping, similar to the decision-making process in pricing American options.
- With more throws, the fair value converges to a higher number, emphasizing the importance of strategic decision-making at each step.
