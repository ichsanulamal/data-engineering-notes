### Module: Incorporating Dividends in the Binomial Model

---

#### Introduction

- **Objective**: Discuss how to include dividends in the binomial model for option pricing.
- **Key Concept**: It's straightforward to incorporate dividends into the binomial model.

---

#### One Period Binomial Model with Dividends

- **Initial Setup**:
  - \( t = 0 \), stock price \( S_0 \)
  - True probabilities \( p \) (up) and \( 1-p \) (down)
  - Up move: \( uS_0 \), Down move: \( dS_0 \)
  - **New Addition**: Proportional dividend \( c \times S_0 \) paid at \( t = 1 \), regardless of stock movement.
  
---

#### No-Arbitrage Conditions

- **Formulas**:
  - \( R \geq d + c \)
  - \( R \leq u + c \)
- **Explanation**:
  - \( d + c \): Total return if the stock price falls
  - \( u + c \): Total return if the stock price rises
  - \( R \): Gross risk-free rate

---

#### Pricing a Derivative Security

- **Portfolio Replication**:
  - \( x \): Units of stock purchased at \( t = 0 \)
  - \( y \): Units of cash account purchased at \( t = 0 \)
  - **Replicating Strategy**:
    - Up move: \( (uS_0 + cS_0)x + Ry = C_u \)
    - Down move: \( (dS_0 + cS_0)x + Ry = C_d \)
  - **Solution**:
    - Derive \( x \) and \( y \) to satisfy these equations
    - **Fair Value**: \( C_0 = xS_0 + y \)
    - **Risk-Neutral Probabilities**:
      - \( q = \frac{R - d - c}{u - d} \)
      - \( 1 - q = \frac{u + c - R}{u - d} \)

---

#### Multi-Period Binomial Model

- **Assumption**: Proportional dividend \( cS_i \) paid at each \( t = i+1 \)
- **Risk-Neutral Probabilities**: Identical in each period, derived similarly as in the one-period model.
- **Backward Induction**: Use risk-neutral probabilities to compute fair values of derivatives.

---

#### Practical Considerations

- **Real-World Dividends**: Often paid semi-annually or annually, complicating calculations.
- **Concept**: Stock without dividends \( S_0 = E_Q[S_n] / R^n \)
- **Stock with Dividends**:
  - **Value**: \( S_0 = E_Q[S_n / R^n] + \sum \frac{D_i}{R^i} \)
  - **Explanation**: \( S_n \) is the ex-dividend stock price at \( t = n \).

---

#### Summary

- **Dividends in Binomial Model**: Easy to include by adjusting formulas for stock and cash account values.
- **Pricing Derivatives**: Adjust replicating strategies and risk-neutral probabilities to account for dividends.
- **Forward Looking**: For complex dividend schedules, consider more advanced models.
