### Pricing Forwards and Futures in the Binomial Model

---

#### Introduction

- **Objective**: Learn how to price forwards and futures in the binomial model.
- **Key Questions**:
  - How are forward and futures prices determined?
  - How do forward prices compare to futures prices?

---

#### n-Period Binomial Model

- **Setup**:
  - \( n = 3 \) periods
  - Up factor \( u \), Down factor \( d \) with \( u = \frac{1}{d} \)
  - Cash account pays a gross risk-free rate \( r \) each period

---

#### Forward Contracts

- **Definition**:
  - Forward contract expiring after \( n \) periods
  - \( G_0 \): Date \( t = 0 \) price of the forward contract (initial value = 0)
- **Payoff**: \( S_n - G_0 \) at maturity
- **Risk-Neutral Pricing**:
  - Initial value: \( 0 = \mathbb{E}_Q \left[ \frac{S_n - G_0}{R^n} \right] \)
  - Solving gives: \( G_0 = \mathbb{E}_Q[S_n] \)

---

#### Impact of Dividends on Forwards

- **Dividends**:
  - Adjust risk-neutral probability \( Q \)
  - \( Q = \frac{R - d - c}{u - d} \)
  - Dividends lower the forward price

---

#### Futures Contracts

- **Definition**:
  - Futures contract expiring after \( n \) periods
  - \( F_t \): Date \( t \) price of the futures contract
- **Key Points**:
  - Futures price \( F_t \) determines cash flow, but initial value is 0
  - Payoff: \( F_t - F_{t-1} \) each period for long position (negative for short)
- **Pricing Method**:
  - At maturity: \( F_n = S_n \)
  - Recursively: \( F_{t} = \mathbb{E}_Q[F_{t+1}] \)

---

#### Comparing Forward and Futures Prices

- **Result**:
  - In the binomial model, forward and futures prices are identical.
  - Formula: \( F_0 = \mathbb{E}_Q[S_n] \)
- **Reason**:
  - Deterministic interest rates allow risk-neutral pricing to align forward and futures prices.
- **General Case**:
  - With random interest rates, futures and forward prices can differ.

---

#### Summary

- **Forwards and Futures**:
  - Both contracts are priced using risk-neutral expectations.
  - Binomial model simplicity ensures identical pricing for forwards and futures.
- **Practical Note**:
  - Real-world scenarios with variable interest rates may lead to differences in prices.
