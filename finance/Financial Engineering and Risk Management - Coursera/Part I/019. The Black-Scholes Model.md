### Black-Scholes Formula Overview

---

#### Introduction

- **Significance**: The Black-Scholes formula is widely used in the financial industry.
- **Relationship**: The binomial model approximates the Black-Scholes formula.

---

#### Assumptions by Black and Scholes

- **Interest Rate**: Continuously compounded interest rate \( R \)
  - \( \$1 \) invested at time 0 grows to \( e^{R \cdot T} \) at time \( T \)
- **Stock Price Dynamics**: Geometric Brownian Motion
  - \( S_t = S_0 e^{( \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t + \sigma W_t} \)
- **Dividend Yield**: Continuous dividend yield \( c \)
- **Trading Conditions**: Continuous trading, no transaction costs, short selling allowed

---

#### Geometric Brownian Motion

- **Sample Paths**: Continuous without jumps
- **Visual**: Paths resemble Brownian Motion

#### Deriving the Black-Scholes Formula

- **European Call Option**:
  - Price: \( C_0 = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2) \)
  - \( d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \)
  - \( d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T} \)
- **Key Insight**: Drift term \( \mu \) does not appear in the final formula

---

#### European Put Option

- **Pricing via Put-Call Parity**:
  - \( P_0 = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1) \)

---

#### Risk-Neutral Pricing

- **Black-Scholes in Risk-Neutral Terms**:
  - Under \( Q \): \( S_t = S_0 e^{(r - c)t + \sigma W_t^Q} \)
  - The drift \( \mu \) is replaced by \( r - c \)

---

#### Black-Scholes in Practice

- **Industry Usage**: Predominant method for quoting option prices
- **Binomial Model Approximation**:
  - Calibrating binomial parameters \( R_n, \sigma_n \) to match Black-Scholes

---

#### Binomial Model Calibration

- **Parameters**:
  - \( R_n = e^{rT/n} \)
  - \( R_n - C_n = e^{(r-c)T/n} \approx 1 + \frac{rT}{n} - \frac{cT}{n} \)
  - \( U_n = e^{\sigma \sqrt{T/n}} \), \( D_n = \frac{1}{U_n} \)
  - Risk-neutral probability \( Q_n \): \( Q_n = \frac{R_n - C_n - D_n}{U_n - D_n} \)

---

#### Convergence to Black-Scholes

- **As \( n \to \infty \)**: Binomial model prices converge to Black-Scholes prices
- **Key Idea**: Delta \( \Delta t \) goes to 0 as \( n \) goes to infinity

---

#### Historical Context

- **Notable Figures**:
  - **Bachelier (1900)**: Early modeling of Brownian motion
  - **Doeblin**: Contributions to stochastic calculus, work discovered posthumously
  - **Ed Thorp**: Card counting in Las Vegas, early use of Black-Scholes formula

---

### Summary

- **Black-Scholes**: Essential for modern finance, derived using geometric Brownian motion
- **Binomial Model**: Approximates Black-Scholes, useful for pricing American options and other derivatives
- **Historical Impact**: Numerous mathematicians and economists contributed to the development of these models
