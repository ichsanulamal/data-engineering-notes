## Time Series Risk Model: Factor Variance

When analyzing the risk of a portfolio using a risk factor model, one of the critical components is the market return, especially as introduced in the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The goal here is to use the market return as a single factor to assess the portfolio variance. The process involves the following steps:

### Covariance Matrix of Factors

With only one factor (the market return), the covariance matrix simplifies to a single value: the variance of the market’s excess return over the risk-free rate. To estimate this variance:

1. **Collect a Time Series**: Gather historical data for a relevant market index like the S&P 500, especially if focusing on the US stock market.
2. **Choose a Time Window**: The choice of window (e.g., 4 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks) depends on the desired balance between recent data relevance and noise reduction.
3. **Calculate the Variance**: Use the chosen time window to compute the variance of the market's excess return.

The time window must be selected judiciously. A very short window might be noisy, while a very long one might include outdated data. The window should match the holding period and trading frequency of the strategy.

### Factor Exposure Matrix

For simplicity, let’s consider a portfolio with two stocks. The factor exposure to the market return for each stock is a key component. This exposure is represented as:

- **Column Vector**: Factor exposure of each stock to the market return.
- **Transpose**: A row vector with two columns.

### Estimating the Variance of Market Factor

To estimate the variance of the market factor:

1. **Collect Index Data**: Use historical data from an index like the S&P 500.
2. **Choose an Appropriate Time Window**: Depending on your trading strategy and holding period.
3. **Compute the Variance**: Calculate the variance over the selected period to represent the market factor’s variance.

## Time Series Risk Model: Factor Exposure

Next, we estimate the factor exposures (Betas) of individual stocks to the market factor using the CAPM framework. 

### Using CAPM for Factor Exposure

CAPM posits that a stock's excess return (above the risk-free rate) can be modeled as:

\[ \text{Stock's Excess Return} = \beta \times \text{Market's Excess Return} \]

where:
- \(\beta\) represents the stock’s exposure to the market factor.

### Estimating Beta via Regression

To estimate \(\beta\):

1. **Collect Time Series Data**: Gather time series data for the market’s excess return and each stock’s excess return.
2. **Run Regression Analysis**: Perform a linear regression with the stock’s excess return as the dependent variable and the market’s excess return as the independent variable.
3. **Interpret the Coefficient**: The regression coefficient (Beta) is the estimate of the stock’s exposure to the market factor.

This regression-based approach is widely used, but it’s worth noting that other methodologies exist and may be employed depending on specific modeling preferences and requirements.

## Time Series Risk Model: Specific Variance

After estimating the factor exposures, the next step is to determine the specific returns and their variances.

### Calculating Specific Returns

Specific return for each period is the residual from subtracting the estimated excess return from the actual excess return:

\[ \text{Specific Return} = \text{Actual Return} - \text{Estimated Return} \]

Where:
- The **Actual Return** is the observed return for the stock.
- The **Estimated Return** is calculated using the regression model.

### Estimating Specific Variance

To find the specific variance:

1. **Calculate Specific Returns**: For each period, subtract the estimated return (from the model) from the actual return.
2. **Compute Variance**: Determine the variance of this specific return time series.

Similar to factor variance, the specific variance estimation also depends on the chosen time window. The specific returns represent the portion of returns not explained by the model, often referred to as residual returns in quantitative finance.

By following these steps, you can effectively use a single-factor risk model to decompose and analyze the variance of a portfolio, enabling more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies.

### 04. M4 L2A 15 Time Series Risk Model V2

Let's revisit our risk model, focusing on the estimation of various matrices: the factor variances and covariances matrix, the factor exposures matrix, and the specific variances matrix. These matrices form the backbone of the covariance matrix for stocks. Specifically, by multiplying the factor exposures by the factor variances and covariances and then adding the specific variances, we obtain the covariance matrix of the stocks. This matrix is crucial for understanding the relationships between different assets.

To compute the portfolio variance, we use the stock weights in the matrices on the left and right ends of this covariance matrix. While the calculation of optimal portfolio weights will be covered in a subsequent lesson, the core idea is that the covariance matrix of assets is a versatile component. It can be used across various portfolios that include a subset of the assets represented in the matrix.

### 05. M4 L2A 16 Fama French Size Factor V2

Building on the previous risk model, we now incorporate two additional factors to create the three-factor Fama-French model. This model is a seminal development in the evolution of multi-factor models. The three factors are:

1. **Market Return**: Represents the overall market performance.
2. **Size**: Measured by market capitalization (market cap), it distinguishes between small-cap and large-cap stocks.
3. **Value**: Typically based on book-to-market ratios, it differentiates between high-value and low-value stocks.

Let's delve into the "Size" factor. Research indicates that small-cap companies often yield higher average returns compared to large-cap companies. For example, if Company ABC, a small-cap stock valued at $1 billion, is compared to Company XYZ, a large-cap stock valued at $10 billion, ABC is expected to have higher risk-adjusted returns.

To quantify this, we construct a portfolio that is long on small-cap stocks and short on large-cap stocks. Tracking the value of this portfolio over time allows us to calculate its daily returns, which represent the returns of the size factor. A positive return indicates that favoring small-cap stocks was beneficial on that day, while a negative return indicates the opposite. This process enables us to quantify the impact of the size factor on returns.

### 06. M4 L2A 17 Fama French Size Factor V3

Although we calculated returns for one specific portfolio, different combinations of stocks can also represent the size factor. For instance, creating multiple portfolios by varying the stocks and the investment proportions can yield different representations of the size factor. 

To generalize this approach, we use a standard portfolio and examine how other portfolios co-vary with it. Portfolios that closely resemble the standard portfolio will exhibit similar movements. By regressing the returns of individual stocks against the returns of this size-based portfolio, we can determine each stock's beta coefficient, indicating its exposure to the size factor.

Fama and French formalized the creation of the size factor as follows:
1. **Estimation Universe**: A representative set of stocks for a region or country's stock market.
2. **Sorting by Market Cap**: Stocks are sorted by their market capitalization.
3. **Portfolio Creation**: The top 90% by market cap form the "Big" portfolio, while the bottom 10% form the "Small" portfolio.
4. **Return Calculation**: Calculate the equal-weighted returns for both portfolios and find the difference (Small minus Big).

This difference, the SMB (Small Minus Big) factor, measures the return attributed to the hypothesis that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks. The daily returns of this long-short portfolio represent the factor returns for the size factor, providing a time series for use in factor models.

In summary, the size factor, denoted SMB, is integral to understanding how small-cap stocks can influence overall portfolio returns, reinforcing the significance of multi-factor models in risk and return analysis.

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model: Value Factor

The third factor in the Fama-French Three-Factor Model is the value factor. Research suggests that stocks with high book values relative to their market prices—often called value stocks—tend to outperform stocks with lower book values relative to their market prices, known as growth stocks. Essentially, stocks that are undervalued based on their fundamentals typically yield higher returns compared to those that are overvalued.

To construct the value factor, sort the stocks in the estimation universe by their book-to-market ratio. Stocks in the top 30% of the book-to-market ratio distribution (above the 70th percentile) form the value portfolio, while those in the bottom 30% (below the 30th percentile) constitute the growth portfolio. According to the Fama-French model, these thresholds define the value (high book-to-market) and growth (low book-to-market) portfolios.

Next, calculate the equal-weighted return of both the value and growth portfolios. The value factor, denoted as HML (High Minus Low), is derived by creating a long/short portfolio that goes long on the value portfolio and shorts the growth portfolio. The daily returns of this long/short portfolio represent the returns attributable to the value factor.

### Combining Size and Value Factors

Fama and French combined the size and value factors by defining portfolios based on both dimensions. Initially, stocks are sorted by market capitalization into small and big groups. Within each group, stocks are further sorted by book-to-market ratio, dividing them into value, neutral, and growth subgroups. This sorting results in six portfolios: small-value, small-neutral, small-growth, big-value, big-neutral, and big-growth.

To compute the size factor (SMB: Small Minus Big), calculate the average returns of the three small portfolios and subtract the average returns of the three big portfolios. For the value factor (HML: High Minus Low), calculate the average returns of the value portfolios (small-value and big-value) and subtract the average returns of the growth portfolios (small-growth and big-growth). Note that neutral portfolios are excluded from the HML calculation.

### Risk Model Using Fama-French Factors

The Fama-French three-factor model is utilized to construct a risk model by calculating the covariance matrix for the market, size, and value factors. The market factor is typically the excess return of a broad market index like the S&P 500. The size factor is derived from a theoretical portfolio that goes long on small stocks and short on big stocks. The value factor comes from a theoretical portfolio that goes long on value stocks and short on growth stocks.

To estimate the factor exposures for each stock, perform a multiple regression where the independent variables are the factor returns (market, size, value) and the dependent variable is the stock return. This process yields the factor exposures for each stock.

The specific variance for each stock, representing the variance not explained by the factors, is computed by first obtaining the specific return (actual return minus the estimated return from the regression). The variance of these specific returns over time gives the specific variance for each stock, which is included in the specific variance matrix.

This approach to risk modeling, known as a Time Series Risk Model, enables the calculation of portfolio variance using the Fama-French factors. Next, we will explore another type of risk model, the cross-sectional risk model.

## 10. Cross-Sectional Risk Model Overview

### Time Series vs. Cross-Sectional Risk Models

In the realm of financial risk modeling, two primary approaches are often discussed: time series risk models and cross-sectional risk models. Understanding the distinction between these two types of models is crucial for financial practitioners.

- **Time Series Risk Models**: These models analyze the behavior of a single asset over multiple time periods. For example, you might have daily return data for a particular stock over the past five years. This type of model helps in understanding how the risk characteristics of that stock evolve over time.

- **Cross-Sectional Risk Models**: In contrast, these models examine multiple assets at a single point in time. For instance, you might analyze the returns of all stocks in a particular index on a given day. This model is used to understand the risk characteristics across different assets at the same time.

### Factor Models in Risk Analysis

Both time series and cross-sectional models use factor models, which involve factor exposures (betas) and factor returns. However, they differ in their approach to estimating these components.

- **Time Series Factor Models**: The factor returns are typically calculated first, often using theoretical portfolios. Once these factor returns are known, the factor exposures for each stock are estimated via regression. This approach helps in capturing the temporal dynamics of risk factors.

- **Cross-Sectional Factor Models**: Here, the factor exposures are calculated first. These exposures are known for each stock at a given time. Then, using the stock returns and these exposures, the factor returns are estimated through regression. This method focuses on understanding how different stocks react to risk factors at a specific point in time.

### Practical Example

Imagine a scenario where you are using the Fama-French three-factor model. In a time series model, you would first calculate the market, size, and value factor returns from theoretical portfolios. Then, using these factor returns, you would estimate the factor exposures (betas) for a stock over time.

In a cross-sectional model, you would start with known factor exposures for all stocks in the market, size, and value categories on a given day. Then, using the stock returns on that day, you would estimate the factor returns.

## 11. Cross-Sectional Risk Model: A Different Approach

### Understanding the Equation

Let's use a simple equation to illustrate the concept: \( z = x \times y \). If we know any two of these variables, we can solve for the third.

- **If \( z \) and \( x \) are known, solve for \( y \)**: \( y = \frac{z}{x} \)
- **If \( z \) and \( y \) are known, solve for \( x \)**: \( x = \frac{z}{y} \)

Applying this to our factor model:

- **Stock Return (\( R \)) = Factor Exposure (\( \beta \)) \times Factor Return (\( F \))**

In a time series model, given stock returns (\( R \)) and factor returns (\( F \)), we estimate the factor exposures (\( \beta \)).

In a cross-sectional model, given stock returns (\( R \)) and factor exposures (\( \beta \)), we estimate the factor returns (\( F \)).

### Flexibility in Regression

Typically, regression involves a dependent variable (often \( y \)), an independent variable (often \( x \)), and a coefficient (often \( \beta \)). By recognizing the flexibility in what we consider as known or unknown variables, we can adapt our regression approach based on the data available.

## 12. Categorical Factors in Cross-Sectional Models

### Examples of Categorical Factors

In cross-sectional risk models, categorical factors such as the country of a company or its sector can significantly influence stock price movements.

- **Country**: Government policies, regulations, and economic conditions in a specific country can impact all companies operating within that country.
  
  *Example*: Regulatory changes in the U.S. might affect all U.S.-based companies similarly.

- **Sector**: Industry-specific factors, such as commodity prices or technological advancements, can affect companies within the same sector.
  
  *Example*: A spike in oil prices might benefit oil and gas companies but hurt airlines.

### Handling Categorical Variables

Unlike numerical data, categorical variables cannot be sorted. Thus, traditional time series models that rely on sorting data to create quantile groups are not applicable.

To incorporate categorical variables in a cross-sectional model, we use methods such as:

- **Dummy Variables**: Each category (e.g., each country or sector) is represented by a binary variable (0 or 1). For instance, if there are 12 unique countries, we create 12 dummy variables.
  
  *Example*: For a stock in the USA, the USA dummy variable would be 1, while all other country dummy variables would be 0.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: This technique is similar to dummy variables but is typically used in machine learning. Each unique category is represented by a separate binary column.

In the context of factor models, the value (0 or 1) assigned to each dummy variable represents the factor exposure of that stock to the specific category.

## Estimating Values for the USA Country Variable

To develop a risk model with a focus on the USA country variable, we begin by defining the factor exposure matrix and its transpose. Each stock's factor exposure to the USA is determined based on whether the company is based in the USA (1 if yes, 0 if no). This binary classification can be refined by using decimal values between 0 and 1 to reflect the proportion of the company’s revenue generated in the USA.

### Factor Exposure and Covariance Matrix

1. **Factor Exposure Matrix**: Each stock is assigned a factor exposure value to the USA country factor. This can be binary or a decimal representing partial exposure. For instance:
   - Apple Inc. (AAPL) might have an exposure of 1 (100% revenue from the USA).
   - A multinational like Coca-Cola (KO) might have an exposure of 0.6 if 60% of its revenue comes from the USA.

2. **Covariance Matrix of Factor Returns**: Simplify the model to one factor – the USA country factor. The covariance matrix, in this case, will be a single value representing the variance of the USA factor return.

### Estimating Factor Returns

To estimate factor returns for a single period:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect data for multiple stocks on a single day, including their returns and factor exposures to the USA.
2. **Regression Model**: Perform a regression of stock returns against their factor exposures. The regression's slope represents the estimated factor return for that day.
3. **Interpretation**: The slope indicates the return attributable to the USA factor exposure.

### Time Series of Factor Returns

By repeating the above regression for multiple time periods, you obtain a time series of factor returns. Calculating the variance of this time series provides the value for the covariance matrix.

## Specific Variance

### Calculating Specific Returns

1. **Actual vs. Estimated Returns**: For each stock, calculate the specific return as the difference between the actual return and the estimated return (based on factor exposures).
2. **Formula**:
   \[
   \text{Specific Return} = \text{Actual Stock Return} - (\text{Factor Exposure} \times \text{Factor Return})
   \]
   For instance, if Apple Inc.'s actual return is 2% on a given day, and the estimated return based on the USA factor is 1.8%, the specific return is 0.2%.

### Time Series of Specific Returns

- Collect specific returns for multiple time periods.
- Calculate the variance of this time series, which will be used in the matrix of specific variances.

## Fundamental Factors in Cross-Sectional Risk Models

Incorporate fundamental factors such as the book-to-market ratio and market capitalization:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Book-to-Market Value: Updated quarterly.
   - Market Cap: Updated daily.

2. **Setting Factor Exposures**: Use book-to-market and market cap directly as factor exposures in the cross-sectional model.

### Regression to Estimate Factor Returns

1. **Perform Regression**: For a single time period, regress stock returns against book-to-market and market cap.
2. **Factor Returns**: The regression coefficients for these factors provide the factor returns.

### Time Series of Factor Returns and Specific Variance

- **Factor Returns**: Repeat the regression for multiple time periods to build a time series.
- **Specific Variance**: Calculate the specific return for each stock and its variance over time.

## Summary

The cross-sectional approach to risk modeling is widely used in commercial risk models. This method involves:
- Estimating factor exposures for each stock.
- Performing regressions to estimate factor returns.
- Building a time series of these returns.
- Calculating specific variances for each stock.

Institutional investors often use commercial risk models from providers like MSCI Barra, Axioma, or Northfield. These models help in focusing on Alpha factors by providing pre-defined risk factors and ensuring the independence of factors and specific returns. The next step in risk modeling involves exploring machine learning approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to derive independent latent factors that explain the most variance in stock returns.
