## What is miner extractable value (MEV) and its significance to most L1 blockchain? Why is there a base fee on every blockchain?

Miner Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the potential profit that miners (or validators, in proof-of-stake systems) can extract from manipulating the order of transactions in a block they are producing. MEV arises because the order in which transactions are included in a block can affect the outcomes of those transactions, allowing miners to extract value by prioritizing certain transactions over others, inserting their own transactions in strategic positions, or censoring certain transactions altogether.

### Significance of MEV to L1 Blockchains

1. **Economic Incentives and Miner Behavior**: MEV creates additional economic incentives for miners beyond the block reward and transaction fees. Miners can earn extra income by exploiting opportunities for arbitrage, liquidation, or front-running. This can lead to behavior where miners prioritize MEV extraction over the network’s health or the fairness of transaction ordering.

2. **Network Security**: High levels of MEV can impact the security of the blockchain. If MEV opportunities become too lucrative, it could encourage selfish mining, where miners collude to maximize MEV at the expense of network stability. This could lead to chain reorganizations and increased centralization risks.

3. **Transaction Fairness**: MEV can undermine the perceived fairness of the blockchain. Users might feel disadvantaged if their transactions are consistently reordered or front-run by miners seeking MEV. This can reduce trust in the network and drive users away.

4. **Gas Fee Volatility**: MEV extraction can lead to higher and more volatile gas fees. When miners focus on MEV, they might ignore transactions with lower fees, causing congestion and higher costs for regular users.

### Base Fee on Blockchains

A base fee is a minimum amount that must be paid for a transaction to be included in a block. This concept is prominently used in Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee mechanism. The base fee serves several purposes:

1. **Mitigating Fee Volatility**: The base fee adjusts dynamically based on network demand. When the network is congested, the base fee increases, and when there is less demand, the base fee decreases. This helps smooth out gas price volatility and provides more predictable transaction costs.

2. **Combating Spam and Denial-of-Service Attacks**: By ensuring that every transaction incurs a minimum cost, the base fee discourages spam transactions and helps protect the network from denial-of-service attacks. This ensures that only transactions with genuine economic intent are included.

3. **Incentivizing Efficient Use of Block Space**: A base fee incentivizes users to be mindful of the space their transactions consume. Users are more likely to optimize their transactions to minimize costs, leading to more efficient use of block space and overall network resources.

4. **Burning Mechanism**: In Ethereum’s implementation, the base fee is burned (destroyed) rather than paid to miners. This introduces a deflationary pressure on the cryptocurrency, potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. This burning mechanism aligns the interests of network users and token holders with the health of the network.

### Summary

MEV is significant because it affects the incentives and behavior of miners, the security and fairness of the blockchain, and the volatility of transaction fees. The base fee helps manage these issues by stabilizing transaction costs, deterring spam, and promoting efficient use of network resources, while also introducing a deflationary mechanism through fee burning.
