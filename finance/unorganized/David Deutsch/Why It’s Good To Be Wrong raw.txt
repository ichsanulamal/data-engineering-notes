[Music] the fallibilism is the philosophical position that um all human Endeavors um attempts to create knowledge or achieve anything are subject to error that there's no such thing as a guarantee that a project to create something new will succeed and in the case of knowledge having got something that you consider knowledge there's no such thing as a foundation which if it's put on that Firm Foundation is guaranteed to be true no such thing as a foundation such that if it's on that Foundation it's guaranteed to be probable or anything like that what we have is um on the other hand fallibilism also says the very idea that we are subject to error implies that there is such a thing as being right that there is such a thing as the truth and that we can sometimes find some of this truth so fallibilism as I understand it is a fundamentally optimistic positive world viw it's not although it's it says we are subject to error the closer you look at that for example uh if you look at its negation which is that there are some things that are infallible some people that are infallible that's that's all a very pessimistic and and frightening kind of take to have on the world yes I am um I think that that the kinds of certainty that have been offered traditionally um I should say that this idea that we can obtain certain truth Justified truth authoritative truth and so on is very old and has permeated both philosophy and and popular culture and everything for thousands of years um the the sources that have always claimed to offer this have not only been factually wrong if you if you just think back to all the different claims of infallibility that have been made in the past including within science you'll see that that uh all of them were built on sand in fact um not only were they factually wrong they also cause tyranny either either intellectual tyranny or actual political tyranny or um Carl poer said that said on one occasion that um uh the the doctrine that the truth is manifest is the root of all tyranny which when I first read it sounded rather uh an exaggerated claim but I I've come to think that that's true everywhere where uh somebody is uh claiming to be entitled to do things against other people's wills and not vice versa uh there is somewhere a claim that the knowledge by which under which they do this is somehow authoritative incontrovertible holy um in some way uh founded on um infallible truth or an infallible Source actually infallibility and infallibility are properties of sources of ideas um ideas themselves are either true or false I think one thing we need to look at uh to be comfortable with with uh not having a foundation is that uh when something is true it doesn't need to be entrenched um CR criticizing it conceiving that it might be false actually strengthens one's understanding of such a truth so if you if you um uh take an idea on board critically then you will see why your criticisms actually fail and criticisms failing is what we actually have that's that's what we that's what is really possible unlike Authority or infallibilism or or whatever if you see that the why the criticisms fail then um you can be comfortable that not that it's true but that the Rival ideas that you might have entertained are false and if they aren't false there'll be some reason that they aren't false which you don't know yet which you need to find VIA criticism again uh and on the other hand if you are told even perfectly true things in a way that either prevents you uh from criticizing or if if you've already given up on criticism and don't criticize yourself then you never really understand why they're true even if they are completely true so people um again it's it's a commonplace observation that people can say pass an exam in a subject get all the questions right uh without ever actually understanding what they're saying so that when they then come up with a practical situation that's framed in a different way from the way that an exam can be framed or a way that they're accustomed to exams Being Framed then they don't know how to connect what they learn to say with the actual situation no uh I've been very lucky that uh uh in my research career I've I've never had to uh take um position in the authoritative hierarchy of either research or university I've always just done research and the only time I ever give lectures or talks or something is when I have something new to say so I I so give a research seminar or something like that but I've never given a course that was for credit to to be honest I although I think that um the authoritative structure of universities isn't good um I I don't the reason I don't participate is it's got nothing to do with getting on my high horse it's just that I don't like it it's it's boring uh you know I want if I give a talk I want to know that the people are sitting there came because they want to they think that I might have something to say that might interest them rather than that they need the remaining four points of this of four credits in order to make up their degree or whatever it is uh yes uh I I have I'm an optimist both in the everyday sense that I'm that I try and look on the bright side but more importantly uh in the sense uh of what this means for for uh for knowledge for for the possibility of growth and progress I always regard failure or any kind of evil as being due to of knowledge and knowledge is obtainable we may not be able to we can't obtain it just by an act of Will by wanting it and we can't ever be sure that we're going to attain it but on the other hand is it it is attainable and we have the means namely rational thought which includes science but also includes every other kind of rational Endeavor uh to to discover knowledge there can't be a most foundational Theory and uh ites seem odd that I should say this um uh and I should say that the foundations don't matter the starting point doesn't matter even though my the whole of my work my research is about trying to discover the foundations of the laws of physics for example and actually the foundations of the laws of physics if you go down deep enough are the foundations of things other than the laws of physics as well the thing is um that's not what foundations are for uh there can't be an ultimate Foundation if you have if you're if you have the right motivation for seeking them because if there were here's a contradiction if there were an ultimate Foundation the question of why that is the ultimate Foundation rather than some other thing would never be answerable so you as soon as you have something you you've discovered something that underlies all the existing theories you want to know why is it that and not something else and uh the the because of fallibility um this process is good and it the fact that it can't end is good um we whenever we solve something thus removing an existing problem from our problem situation we automatically create more problems what's more they are deeper problems for this very reason so they're deeper and more interesting problems than what we had before I think that the there is a good and a bad side to the rise of the expert um the the benign aspect is that information is growing exponentially and is indeed growing faster than any human can can possibly know can possibly assimilate now um that's not important because what um we ought to be doing is trying to understand the world and delegating information processing to Mindless computers or to other kinds of machines so it is possible to have a broad perspective on knowledge there's been a sociological phenomenon in the intellectual World in universities and and in society generally to um confuse these two things the the information type knowledge and understanding type knowledge so that people are trained that people acquire their understanding much too much via acquiring the information in some Fields like for example medicine technology has for several decades not caught up with the need for a lot of information to be stored in a human brain and that for some people and certainly more in other fields where it wasn't so necessary has been at at the expense of having a broad understanding that never was necessary and I think that in the future as the means of dealing with brute information become more and more easy and convenient um people will no longer see themselves as holders of that kind of information and people won't value other people who are holders of that kind of information but instead they will value in themselves and in other people explanatory information which is not fragmenting new knowledge is typically unifying not fragmenting I mean fragmenting does happen but uh typically an an a fundamental new discovery unifies things and therefore makes it easier to understand a broader field the distinction between beautiful and ugly is objective is the only way we can explain why the only animals in nature that appreciate flowers in the sense that they are attracted by flowers are insects and humans now why is that um insects we know why it's because the the insect species and the flower species co-evolved their gen means to make the insects attracted attracted to the flowers and the flowers attractive to the insects that doesn't explain why humans like flowers because most things in the animal world that evolve to be attractive to other animals we find repulsive at least I do um so you know um ugly animals um what whatever animals you don't like first of all the theory only says that are that Aesthetics can improve not that it must and not that it has now I think what's happened in art Fine Art um is a rather unusual thing uh which is that the um Elite the Elites in Fine Art went backwards for several decades and rebelled against the very idea of Truth or in what in their case Beauty they rebelled against that so they they uh they reconceived art as being uh intended to either intended to uh serve a practical purpose like socialist realism or something or to uh shock people out of their complacency or to uh supersede something or to transcend boundaries something like that rather than to pursue Beauty and if physicists had conceived of physics in that way physics would have gone backwards um so um however I don't agree with people who think that Civilization even in the sense of Art and the humanities and so on has gone backwards because at the same time that this was happening the broader picture of art was actually improving for a start an entire new art form came into existence namely Cinema and that is clearly has made progress over the decades not just technological progress but progress in the sense of um uh new ways of have new ways of something being a movie uh new ways of of acting in a movie and then television came along and people were saying ah this will be the death of the movie industry but the exact opposite happened it on the one hand enhanced and diversified the movie industry and secondly created a whole other art form in parallel with that one namely television they overlap but um so I think um this is another of those situations where um the the I I'm not sure if I can call it the institutions in in this but but the the broad momentum of what real people were doing was much wiser than what the experts thought they should be doing and what the experts tried to do so the experts went haywire for a while I think even that is now um I I won't say it's back on track but I I think that tendency has been successfully criticized and there are people who would like to go back to making actual progress in regard to actual Beauty I think that morality has been progressing much more slowly than progress in science but it's nevertheless clearly been progressing if you look back say to to 19th century uh there was a situation in which a large proportion of was say in the early 19th century most civilized people uh had little or no objection to slavery and very few people thought it was an absolute Abomination whereas today the overwhelming majority of people the overwhelming consensus is that it's an absolute Abomination that is a an objective change nobody can deny that that change has actually happened and I would argue that morally that change has been for the better and it hasn't just been in these sort of big issue things you've only got to watch and and over that length of time scale you've only got to watch say a television program from a few decades ago uh watch early series of Star Trek for example which was a program that was consciously trying to look ahead to see what society would be like in the future and it's it's got things which are like uh um you remember an episode where there was a female Captain who couldn't hack it as Captain because she was a female now we now not only is that now Politically Incorrect they wouldn't be sort of allowed to do it but which I think by the way is a bad tendency um but the reason but the thing I'm pointing out is not that they wouldn't be allowed to do it it's that it seems ridiculous most people today consider that theory ridiculous so uh and that is also moral progress so uh and this moral progress happened in some societies and not others and that's a very important fact the distinction the difference between the Societies in which it did happen in which it didn't happen are the the institutions that that deal with ideas the the whether ideas are thought to be authoritatively derived or criticized and uh the Societies in which this progress took place were the ones that were best that had best institutionalized criticism this this idea of a tradition of criticism is is itself an almost paradoxical thing like fism itself because throughout human history people have lived by tradition and tradition means doing the same thing generation after generation whereas criticism means trying to change things moment to moment let alone generation to generation but nevertheless there is such a thing as a tradition of criticism and it's the most valuable thing in the world it's the thing that all progress not only political but everything else depends on the the first couple of Seasons anyway um of house were a remarkable exploration of epistemology it seemed to me uh you there there all sorts of side things about the series that were fun like the portrayal of this eccentric idiosyncratic character although even then it they built the personal quirks around the epistemology so there was I remember there was an episode where uh the world's leading expert in something or other I think it was tuberculosis or something was was ill and said that he had tuberculosis and how said no you don't and he said why why not well because you've got atypical symptoms it's um you've got to and and the expert said no that's I've seen thousands of cases of this you've only seen a handful of cases in your whole career I've seen thousands of cases and I know that this disease can present atypically and house said the fact that you've seen thousands of cases is exactly why you're not the right person to make this decision uh this is the gamblers fallacy you see uh or is it the inverse gamblers fallacy or whatever the the uh the expert in thousands of cases of tuberculosis who doesn't have a broad understanding of other diseases to match his understanding of tuberculosis is going to be terribly subject to bias he's going to be trying to explain things in terms of the things that he knows and if you're trying to explain an unknown thing um you want and in terms of your expertise you've got to be careful that the expertise itself doesn't bias you every time house uh uh makes this kind of decision he he um allows for his own expertise so he's all whenever he has a theory he wants to test it right away and you know in the drama of the series that usually involves risking the patient's life or something you just to make it more exciting but but the logic of it is that you form an explanation which is the best available explanation at the time um there are other explanations that are not quite as good but are also viable explanations in that they're not just pulled out of a hat like for example you know it's a disease we've never heard of period now that could be true but that it's a bad explanation because it you could always say that no matter what the patient was so you have to that there's a methodological rule that you don't consider that kind of explanation you've got to say in that case it could be a disease we've never heard of that does so and so and is testable so then he has the best explanation and then he immediately tests it and what usually happens is that the test proves him wrong that's that's another um remarkable thing because usually when a a fictional uh story wants to portray somebody as superhuman you know to have superpowers or something they overwhelmingly have to show the superpower working but with house yes he usually gets it right eventually but he almost never gets it right immediately and I've never seen that before um so that's that's why I I like the epistemology in that series uh that happened when I was an undergraduate uh it was an a tremendous Stroke of Luck I I think this must count as the biggest Stroke of Luck in my whole career um I um had um well so I was interested in in theoretical um the theoretical side of physics this was before even becoming interested in foundational side I was interested in the theoretical side and therefore I thought that I needed to fully understand the relationship between the experimental and theoretical side of physics because the theoretical side is useless if it becomes disconnected from experimental physics so not wanting to do actual experiments myself because every experiment I tried failed um but nevertheless I wanted to understand what the connection was so I read bertr and Russell because uh Russell was I think probably just about the only philosopher I'd ever heard of and he he wrote uh books about induction and the scientific method and so on so I I read that and I thought that I understood it and of course everything I read There was completely wrong um it was empiricism inductivism all these horrible mistakes uh even gave he wasn't a positivist but he gave some Credence to positivist ideas as well uh but I wrote it all down uh to try and clarify my ideas and uh I showed it to my tutor now uh you should understand that in Cambridge terminology a tutor isn't a tutor it's the I don't know what you call them in America um here in Oxford they're called moral tutors uh it's a person who's like your contact person in the University who like if you get into trouble that's who you go to he'll stand up for you uh that kind of thing and you the the practice was that we would go to see him at the beginning of each term and at the end of each term uh to say hello and you know he would say do you have any problems and that kind of thing so I never had anything to say to him and so I thought well I'll take this essay that I wrote and I I I sent him the essay before I went to see him I went and and I said you did you read the essay you know what do you think he was his historian Charles Parkin was his name he was uh professor of History um uh and uh he said yes um I read it you know it it it seems all right uh but this induction stuff hasn't that all been disproved by that POA chappie and and I had only once before even heard of Poa uh and certainly had no intention of reading him and and it's really amazing that Charles Parkin even had the idea that inductivism had been refuted by POA because that was uh contrary to what the overwhelming majority of philosoph professional philosophers thought at the time they thought that POA was just ridiculous for having claimed to solve the problem of induction and to have an epistemology that superseded inductivism by the way I think even today the majority of philosophers would say that um but in those days Papa was you know just unheard of in in that kind of area but somehow he had heard of it somehow he told me about it somehow I got the idea of getting a book of poppers out of the library and uh I was bowled over because the standard of argument was simply Head and Shoulders above anything I'd read in in bertran Russell so uh you know I in I with the hindsight I could see that bertran Russell was trying to kind of fob me off with things that aren't really arguments um whereas Papa was getting to grips with the actual thing and finding yes this part is right this part is wrong this is why uh and so on as far back as I can remember I I wanted to be what I now call a physicist but for some reason and I don't know how this happened but for some reason I didn't ever know what physics is until I was 11 and encountered a physics lesson in the school that I entered at the age of of 11 um somehow it had passed me by that that this thing and as soon as I realized what that subject is I knew that I want to be a physicist I I can more easily answer the question if I wasn't allowed to be any kind of scientist okay um then I would be a film director yes but uh I think it's not a well formed question in the case of science because if I was somehow prohibited from being a physicist I would tend in that direction as close as the prohibition allowed as I think in fact I have done I mean the way that I got to the particular take on physics that I have is by finding that that's where I tend to by trying to solve things
