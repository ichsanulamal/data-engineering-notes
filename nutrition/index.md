Thanks for sharing the details! Based on your goal to gain weight, build muscle, and improve energy, I’ll design a plan that increases your calorie intake with balanced macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fats). I’ll also focus on nutrient-dense foods that suit your preferences as you're in Semarang, Indonesia.

### Key Focus Areas for Your Diet:
1. **Increase Caloric Intake:**
   - You’ll need a slight calorie surplus to gain weight gradually. We’ll focus on adding nutrient-rich, calorie-dense foods to help build muscle, without gaining too much fat.

2. **Protein for Muscle Growth:**
   - Since you’re doing beginner workouts, protein will be crucial for recovery and muscle building.

3. **Carbohydrates for Energy:**
   - Carbs are important to fuel your workouts and daily activities.

4. **Healthy Fats:**
   - Essential fats will support overall health and add extra calories.

### Estimated Caloric Needs:
- At 169 cm (5'6") and 58 kg (127 lbs), with a beginner workout routine, you likely need around **2,200–2,400 calories per day** to gain weight and muscle. I’ll suggest meals to fit this range.

### Sample Diet Plan:

**Breakfast**  7:00 AM – 8:00 AM
- 2 slices of bread with peanut butter (protein + healthy fats)
- 2 boiled eggs or a vegetable omelette
- 250 ml milk (you already have this habit—great for extra protein!)
- Add 1 banana (or another fruit like papaya) for more calories and vitamins

**Snack (Mid-Morning)**  10:00 AM – 11:00 AM
- Smoothie: Blend 250 ml milk with 1 banana, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon oats
- Or: 1 serving of tempeh/tahu (tofu) with soy sauce for extra protein

**Lunch**  12:30 PM – 1:30 PM
- 1½–2 servings of rice
- Protein source: 150–200g of chicken, fish (ikan), shrimp (udang), or tempeh/tahu
- 1 serving of vegetables (spinach, broccoli, or any local greens)
- Add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil or olive oil for healthy fats

**Snack (Mid-Afternoon)**  3:30 PM – 4:30 PM
- 1 handful of mixed nuts (almonds, cashews) or roasted peanuts (kacang tanah)
- Or: 1 serving of tahu goreng or a hard-boiled egg

**Dinner**  6:30 PM – 7:30 PM
- 1½–2 servings of rice or sweet potatoes (ubi)
- Protein source: Grilled or fried fish (ikan bakar/goreng), chicken satay (sate ayam), or beef (rendang, if possible)
- 1 serving of vegetables (carrot, kale, kangkung)
- Add avocado slices (alpukat) or sautéed tempeh for more calories and healthy fats

**Before Bed (Optional)**  9:00 PM – 10:00 PM
- A glass of warm milk or a smoothie with milk and fruit (banana, papaya)

### General Tips:
1. **Protein Focus:** Aim for 100-120 grams of protein per day. Incorporate high-protein foods like tempeh, tahu, chicken, fish, eggs, and nuts in every meal.
   
2. **Carbohydrate Increase:** For muscle building and energy, you should increase your rice, noodles (mie), or potato intake. Whole grains or starches like rice, sweet potatoes (ubi), and corn are great.

3. **Healthy Fats:** Use cooking oils like coconut oil, olive oil, or palm oil for frying or sautéing. Foods like peanuts, peanut butter, avocado, and tempeh will also boost your calorie intake.

4. **Workout Nutrition:** Eat a small snack high in carbs and protein before your workout, like a banana and a handful of nuts, to fuel exercise. Afterward, have a protein-rich meal to support recovery (e.g., a smoothie with milk, banana, and peanut butter).

### Example of Indonesian Foods to Include:
- **Protein sources**: Tempeh, tahu, telur (eggs), ikan (fish), ayam (chicken), udang (shrimp)
- **Carbs**: Rice (nasi), mie (noodles), nasi goreng, jagung (corn), ubi (sweet potatoes)
